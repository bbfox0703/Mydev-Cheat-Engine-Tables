This program is designed to help users generate Lua On/Off scripts for Cheat Engine. Here's how it works:

1. **Select a Cheat Engine Table File**:
   - The program opens a file dialog allowing the user to select a `.CT` (Cheat Engine Table) file.

2. **Parse the XML File**:
   - It reads the `.CT` file as XML and extracts entries with `Auto Assembler Script` or those with specific options (e.g., `moHideChildren=1`).

3. **Display a TreeView**:
   - The program shows a TreeView UI for users to explore and select entries.
   - Each entry is displayed hierarchically based on its depth in the `.CT` file.
   - A numeric selector allows users to control how many levels of the TreeView are expanded.

4. **Generate Lua Scripts**:
   - Based on the selected entries, the program generates two Lua script sections:
     - `[ENABLE]`: Activates the selected entries in ascending order of their hierarchy.
     - `[DISABLE]`: Deactivates all entries (irrespective of user selection) in reverse hierarchical order.
   - The Lua script includes comments with metadata (ID, description, and depth) for each entry.

5. **Display the Script**:
   - The generated Lua script is shown in a syntax-highlighted editor using Scintilla.

6. **UI Enhancements**:
   - The program is DPI-aware and uses intuitive UI components like labels, numeric selectors, and checkboxes to enhance usability.

This tool simplifies the process of managing and customizing Cheat Engine Lua scripts, especially for users working with complex `.CT` files.
