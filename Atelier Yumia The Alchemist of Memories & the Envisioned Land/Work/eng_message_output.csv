STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_021,Time for some decorating.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_022,I want this place to feel nice and comfy.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_023,I should put something here.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_024,It feels a bit too boring in here.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_025,Where should I put this?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_026,Where would be best?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_027,"Actually, never mind."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_028,I'll put that away.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_029,This looks good.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_030,Maybe around here?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_031,"Hm, is this really the best spot?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_032,"I want this place to look its best, but ..."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_033,What should I go with?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_034,What furniture should I place?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_035,Hmm ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_036,What next?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_037,How many should I make?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_038,This could probably fit about ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_039,Maybe one is enough?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_040,It might be best to make a bunch just in case.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_041,I think this looks good.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_042,Looks about right!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_043,What kind of base should I build?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_044,I want the sort of base where anything's possible!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_045,"I'm going to make it how I like it, of course."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_046,What kind of style should it have?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_047,Something like this?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_048,This is it!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_049,Is there anything here I'd like?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_050,What I'd really like is ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_051,I think this one's growing on me.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_052,This looks all right.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_053,I want to make sure I pick good materials.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_054,The sturdiest-looking materials are ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_055,This looks good.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_056,I think this will work.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_057,Where should I put this?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_058,Where would be best?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_059,I don't think the location matters that much ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_060,"Which spot gets the most sun? And ventilation's important, too ..."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_061,This looks like it'll work.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_062,This spot should do.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_063,What should I make?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_064,Which one should I make?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_065,"So, what I need is ..."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_066,I guess there's no hurry or anything.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_067,Here we go!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_068,This should do it!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_069,What do I have again?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_070,This could work.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_071,What should I make?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_072,"Hm, which one?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_073,Do I have the ingredients for that?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_074,"Okay, let's pick ..."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_075,Maybe I should sort my ingredients while I'm here.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_076,... Am I overthinking this?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_077,Which one should I go with?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_078,I think I could use ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_079,The best ones for this would be ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_080,What seems useful for this ...?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_081,"This one's reliable, and it feels pretty strong."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_082,"I don't know how to explain it, but this one feels almost ... reassuring?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_083,"U-um, is this making anyone else feel uneasy ...?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_084,S-something seems a bit off about this one ... Should I really use it ...?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_085,"This should be good, right?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_086,Something like this?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_087,I hope this comes out well.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_088,"Okay, how does it look?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_089,"Nice, it's done."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_090,This looks good.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_091,It's perfect!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_092,It turned out so well!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_093,Which one should I go with?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_094,I think I could use ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_095,This should work.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_096,Maybe this is okay?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_097,Looks like it worked out.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_098,It's as good as new.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_099,The node is reacting.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_100,Great! The node's level went up.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_101,I found an attribute!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_102,"Okay, let's keep this up."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_103,Did the core get stronger?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_104,The attribute's power is a lot higher now.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_105,Which one should I go with?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_106,I could really use some more ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_107,Maybe I should make more?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_108,"I should make a lot of this, just in case."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_109,"Yep, it's just like the original."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_110,That came out perfect!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_111,Which one should I pick?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_112,"Hm, what I should use ...?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_113,I think this should be good.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_114,Let's give this a go!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_115,I hope this works.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_116,I hope this is enough.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_117,"Yeah, this ought to do it."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_118,Looks like it worked out.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_119,Let's see ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_120,I should think it over carefully ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_121,Which traits would work best?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_122,"Okay, time to pick some traits ..."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_123,What combination would be good?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_124,"Hm, this would go well with ..."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_127,Something like this?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_128,This ought to do it.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_129,I hope this works.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_130,This will probably do it.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_131,Looks like it worked out.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_132,Looks like it worked out.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_133,What sort of thing would be good?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_134,What kind of recipe am I in the mood for ...?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_135,Which recipe should I go with?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_136,"Hm, which one?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_137,I'll make this.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_138,I think I've already got everything for this.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_139,"Okay, so that's how it works."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_140,"Yep, I think I get it!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_141,I think this is as far as I can push this recipe.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_142,I don't think I can make this any more powerful.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_143,Found some!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_144,This is it!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_145,"Wow, what a find!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_146,I found something really nice!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_147,This doesn't look doable unless we have energy ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_148,I should probably organize my bag first.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_149,What's this?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_150,"Hey, isn't this ..."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_151,Gotcha.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_152,All right.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_153,Come here!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_154,Caught you.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_157,Hiyah!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_158,Take that!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_159,I'll just scoop up a bit.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_160,I should draw some water.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_161,I wonder what I'll catch.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_162,Let's get a big one.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_163,Here we go!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_164,This'll do it.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_167,Fire!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_168,"C'mon, hit!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_169,It's in my sights.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_170,Direct hit.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_171,Kapow!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_172,This is the one!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_173,Go!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_174,Knock it all down.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_177,Woo!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_178,Hup!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_179,Higher!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_180,Almost!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_181,Hah!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_182,Hah!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_183,Up I go!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_184,Hup!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_185,Ow!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_186,Ugh!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_187,Phew. I'm getting tired.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_188,Better get moving.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_189,Let's dash away!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_190,Time to leave this place in our dust!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_191,There!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_192,This will do it!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_193,We'd better save our energy.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_194,Let's walk from here.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_195,There!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_196,Go!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_197,This way?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_198,It's pretty heavy ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_199,Here we go!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_200,One ... two!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_201,Ngh ... It's heavy.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_202,"Ready, and ...!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_203,"And, push!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_204,Does this thing move?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_205,Better hurry.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_206,There's no time!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_207,What's in here?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_208,Open up!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_209,I don't want to get caught in this thing ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_210,It's a bit heavy ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_211,"Just spin this, and ..."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_212,What happens now?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_217,Time for a scan.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_218,"Run a scan, Flammi."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_219,Scanning ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_220,Commencing scan.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_225,What a mess. Can this really be fixed?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_226,Hmm. How am I going to fix this ...?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_227,Just do this. And then ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_228,This should do it ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_229,"All right, all fixed."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_230,"Yeah, I think that should do it."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_231,... Huh? It's still broken.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_232,"Hmm, this is pretty tricky."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_233,Sometimes you've just got to force it!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_234,Just needs a bit of elbow grease!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_235,"Ooh, what's inside?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_236,I just hope this isn't a trap ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_237,All the way!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_238,This feels great!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_239,Maybe the other end's busted?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_240,... Huh? I don't have any ropes.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_241,Just need a quick little recharge.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_242,That ought to do it.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_243,Looks like it's not full yet.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_244,I guess it's going to be a while.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_245,This looks like the perfect spot to rest.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_246,Should we take a quick break?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_247,How long should we rest?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_248,Better take the time to rest up.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_249,About this long?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_250,Probably about this long.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_251,Phew. Time for a little nap.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_252,"I need to sit down. Boy, am I tired."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_253,What am I in the mood for?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_254,I could probably make ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_255,"Yep, this should be good."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_256,This looks really good.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_257,I'll have this ready in a flash!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_258,"Okay, let's make it!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_259,Let's dig in!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_260,Time to eat.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_261,Let's dig in!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_262,Let's hurry up and eat!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_263,"Yes, let's eat."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_264,Let's eat!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_265,Time for pets!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_266,Who's a good dog? You are!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_267,"What's up, kitty cat?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_268,"Aw, is it purring?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_269,"Wow, what a pretty bird."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_270,I wonder where that bird's headed?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_271,"Don't worry, we won't harm you."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_272,What a friendly goat.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_287,Home sweet home.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_288,Phew. I need a break.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_301,Where should we go?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_302,Any idea where we should go?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_303,Where to next?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_304,We going somewhere?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_305,Where shall we go?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_306,Where do you all want to go?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_307,Please select a destination.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_308,Here?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_309,"This should be good, right?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_310,"So, this spot's okay?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_311,Just pick somewhere already.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_312,Are you certain this is the place?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_313,Does this spot work?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_314,Have you settled on a destination?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_315,I'm wiped. Maybe we should head back for now ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_316,Are we returning to the atelier?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_317,Are we heading back to the atelier?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_318,Huh? We're headin' back already?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_319,You should not push yourself too hard.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_320,Hm? We're leaving?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_321,Have you settled on a destination?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_322,That should be close enough.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_323,That's not too far away.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_324,That's super close.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_325,Didn't even have to open the map for this one.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_326,"Goodness, that's nearby."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_327,We'll be there in no time!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_328,Have you settled on a route?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_329,I think we should turn this quest down.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_330,This one might be a bit too much.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_331,I feel sort of bad.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_332,We should choose more carefully from now on.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_333,"I mean, we could probably lend a hand."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_334,"I don't know, should we ...?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_335,"No problem, just leave it to me!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_336,Why don't we give it a shot?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_337,"Oh, I've already got that."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_338,Looks like I can report that right now!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_339,"Hey, a barrel."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_340,Looks like a barrel.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_341,Woooooo! A barrel!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_342,Nice barrel.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_343,A barrel.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_344,That's a barrel.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_345,B-b-b is for barrel!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_346,A barrel.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_347,It's just a barrel.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_348,A barrel.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_349,This is a nice barrel.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_350,It's a barrel!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_351,It's a barrel ... right?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_352,A barrel.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_353,Are you not familiar with barrels?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_354,Good morning!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_355,Hello there.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_356,Good evening!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_357,Hi.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_358,Do you have a moment?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_359,How about a trade?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_360,I wonder what they've got.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_361,I could probably trade for ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_362,How many should I exchange?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_363,"Okay, how many ...?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_364,Looks like I'm a little short.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_365,"Whoops, I don't have enough room."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_366,"Yep, that works for me."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_367,Trade complete.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_368,That was a good trade.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_369,I'll come back again sometime.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_370,Thanks. See you next time.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_371,G'morning.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_372,Hello.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_373,Evening.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_374,Hey there.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_375,Looking to barter?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_376,I've got some good stuff for you.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_377,What'll it be?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_378,See anything you like?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_379,How many are you going to trade?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_380,How many is it going to be?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_381,"Can't trade for so few, sorry."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_382,You'd better get your bags in order first.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_383,"Yep, that works for me."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_384,Pleasure doing business with you.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_385,That turned out to be a good trade.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_386,Here to drop something off for me?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_387,Got something for me?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_388,I was looking for this!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_389,You're okay to part with this stuff?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_390,"Thanks, that'll help."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_391,"Thanks, I'll definitely take that off your hands."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_392,"Let me know when you get more good stuff, all right?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_393,I'll be looking forward to next time.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_394,"Hey there! Nice mornin', huh?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_395,Yo! Takin' a look around?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_396,"*Yawn* ... I should be hittin' the hay, so could you be quick?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_397,Hey! Here to trade?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_398,"What, are you lookin' to trade?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_399,Haha! I've got some good stuff in stock!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_400,"Well? Nothin' but the best here, right?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_401,Did you bring somethin' worth tradin'?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_402,You're good with just the one?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_403,How many are you goin' to trade?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_404,"Whoa, hold up. That's not goin' to work."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_405,"Well, you're not gettin' this home."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_406,How's that?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_407,Sounds like a deal!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_408,"Yep, that was a solid trade."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_409,Oh! Did you bring me somethin'?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_410,Mind showin' me what you've brought?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_411,That's it! I've been lookin' all over for this!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_412,You're sure I can have this?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_413,"Thanks, you're a lifesaver!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_414,"Thanks, I owe ya one."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_415,Drop on by again!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_416,See ya around!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_417,"You're up bright and early, huh?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_418,"Hey, how's it going?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_419,"Heh heh, good evening."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_420,You look like you've got something good on you.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_421,Here for some trading?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_422,Want to check out the rare stuff?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_423,Everything here's worth a look!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_424,"You've got enough to cover this, right?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_425,How many do you want?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_426,"I've got plenty, so you can trade for as much as you'd like."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_427,"Nope, that's not going to cut it."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_428,"Sort through your bags and we'll try this again, okay?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_429,"All right, let's get this show on the road."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_430,Heh heh. That's a fair trade.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_431,"Heh heh, thanks for that one!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_432,"Hey, is that what I asked for?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_433,Now let's see what you brought.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_434,"Okay, hand it over!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_435,"Come on, don't keep me waiting!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_436,"Heh heh, much obliged."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_437,"Yeah, I'd say that was worth the wait."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_438,Stop by whenever you've got something good!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_439,Heh heh ... Thanks for the marvelous deal.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_440,Good morning! Are you stocking up on supplies?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_441,Hello! Why don't you stop and browse?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_442,Good evening! We've got all sorts of great things in stock!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_443,"Oh, were you looking to trade?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_444,"Have my wares caught your eye? Go ahead, browse as much as you want!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_445,I just got some great new goods!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_446,Did anything strike your fancy?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_447,"Well? There's plenty to see here, right?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_448,How many would you like?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_449,You want a whole pile of them?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_450,No can do! That's not enough to trade.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_451,I don't think you can carry this.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_452,"I'm fine with this exchange, but are you?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_453,"Thanks, that was a great deal!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_454,"This worked out well, thanks."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_455,"Ooh, is that what I asked for?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_456,You actually brought it?!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_457,You don't mind?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_458,I can have this?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_459,"Thanks, you have no idea how much this helps!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_460,"Thanks, I knew I could count on you!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_461,I'll try to find some other things that are worth a trade.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_462,Be sure to stop by again sometime!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_463,Oh! Good morning!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_464,"Hello, do you have something to trade?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_465,Good evening. What brings you here at this hour?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_466,Tee hee! You'd like to trade with me?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_467,"Ah, did you want to trade?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_468,I've got all sorts of things that you could trade for!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_469,Has anything caught your eye?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_470,Did you find anything you like?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_471,How many did you need?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_472,You're looking for a ton of them?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_473,"Sorry, I can't actually take so few."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_474,It's dangerous to carry more than you can handle.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_475,Is this all right?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_476,"This turned out to be a good deal for me, too."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_477,I'm glad that we've got a similar eye for value.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_478,Did you bring me the you-know-what?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_479,Oh! Is this the thing I was looking for?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_480,You're sure I can have this?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_481,Could this possibly be what I requested?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_482,"Goodness, that helps so much. Thank you."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_483,"Thank you, this is such a relief."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_484,I'll see what else I can find for you.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_485,"Please, stop by whenever you'd like."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_486,You sure are busy first thing in the morning!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_487,"It's lunchtime, why don't you take a break?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_488,You've got quite the energy at this time of night.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_489,Were you hoping to trade?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_490,"Looking to trade? I hope you won't say ""no."""
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_491,"I've got things to do, so make it quick!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_492,"I can only trade certain things, okay?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_493,"Until you exchange something, you're just browsing."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_494,How many can you trade for?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_495,"No matter how many you go for, you're not getting any freebies."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_496,Why don't we try this again?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_497,"So, you're basically just window shopping."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_498,"Once the deal's done, there are no buybacks."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_499,"All right, that's that!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_500,"Great, this was a good trade."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_501,"Heeey, is that the thing I asked for?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_502,"Oh, right! I forgot I asked for that."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_503,"I can have this, yeah?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_504,"Come on, hurry up and fork it over!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_505,I knew asking you was a good idea. Thanks!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_506,Nice job. I'll be sure to ask you for help again.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_507,See you around.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_508,"All right, see you next time."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_509,Mooooornin'! What've you got for me?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_510,Afternooooon! What can I getcha?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_511,Eeeeevenin'! ... Shouldn't you be sleeping?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_512,Trades! Exchanges! We do it all!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_513,We've got stuff here that'll make your hair stand on end!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_514,"There are tons of great things here! C'mon, you know you want 'em!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_515,"Let me know what you're looking for, m'kay?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_516,See? We've got plenty of exciting stuff!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_517,Just the one? Or maybe more?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_518,You want the lot?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_519,"Nope, no can do!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_520,"You can't carry all this, so that's out!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_521,You don't mind trading for this?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_522,Yay! Pleasure doing business with you!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_523,I love deals that make me smile!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_524,"Oooh, is this what I asked for?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_525,"You have something for me, right? Right?!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_526,You don't mind that I take this?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_527,You're really giving this to me?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_528,Yay! Thanks!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_529,I got something that makes me smile!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_530,Take care out there!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_531,See you some other time!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_532,"Well, you sure are up early."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_533,Humans are a rare sight. ... So? What did you need?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_534,What brings you here at this hour?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_535,"Humans, huh? ... What brings you here?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_536,Is there something I can help you with?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_537,"If there's anything you want to tell me, I'm all ears."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_538,What you see is what we've got.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_539,Have you spotted anything you want?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_540,How many?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_541,How many should that be?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_542,"You're going to have to try this again, human."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_543,Come back later when your bags aren't as full.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_544,Are you sure?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_545,That was a perfectly satisfying trade.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_546,That was a splendid trade.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_547,Did you bring me anything?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_548,Would you mind showing it to me?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_549,You wouldn't mind?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_550,You're sure I can have this?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_551,"Thank you, I won't say no to that."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_552,You've got a wonderful way of getting the job done.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_553,Stop by whenever you'd like.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_554,"Take care, all right?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_555,"You're one of those early bird-types, huh?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_556,A human? What business do you have with me?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_557,"So, you're a human who likes to burn the midnight oil."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_558,"Goodness, a human. Is something wrong?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_559,Do you need some assistance?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_560,I don't mind listening to anything you'd like to talk about.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_561,"There isn't all that much I can offer, but ..."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_562,This is about everything I can trade.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_563,How many would you like?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_564,How many should that be?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_565,"Hm, you'll have to try that again."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_566,You'll have to repack your bags first.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_567,Would you like to make this trade?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_568,"That was a good trade, human."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_569,"There, that was a fair trade."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_570,Oh? Do you have something for me?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_571,"Come on, let me see!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_572,You're sure I can have this?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_573,You're sure about this?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_574,"Wonderful, that's that. Thank you."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_575,"Thank you, I didn't think I'd ever be able to get my hands on this."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_576,Take care out there.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_577,Feel free to call on me whenever you'd like.

STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_593,"Show me, show me. What did. You bring?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_594,"Did you bring. What I asked for? Quick, show me."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_595,I will take this. Is that. Okay?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_596,"You sure, you sure? I will take this."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_597,"Thank you, human. I am. Happy."

STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_611,
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_612,
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_613,
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_614,"Your business, I thank you for."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_615,"Splendid, yes."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_616,"What I requested, you have brought me?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_617,"What you have brought, show me."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_618,"If I take this, is it all right?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_619,"Correct, is this?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_620,"I accept, yes."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_621,"My thanks, you have."

STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_624,Mornin'.

STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_632,How many do you want to trade?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_633,How many?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_634,I'm going to need more than that.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_635,Doesn't look like you can carry this.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_636,Does this look all right?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_637,Thanks for the trade.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_638,It's a deal.

STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_673,Welcome!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_674,Do you have anything you'd like to trade?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_675,What did you need?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_676,Take a look at what I have.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_677,See anything you like?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_678,How many would you like?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_679,Okay. And how many?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_680,"Sorry, that's not enough."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_681,I don't think you can carry this right now.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_682,Does this look all right?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_683,That was a lovely exchange.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_684,Then we have a deal.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_685,Did you bring me anything nice?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_686,What are you going to give me?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_687,Is this right?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_688,"So, this is what you want to give me?"

STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_697,Do you have anything you'd like to trade?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_698,What did you need?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_699,Take a look at what I have.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_700,See anything you like?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_701,How many would you like?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_702,Okay. And how many?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_703,"Sorry, that's not enough."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_704,I don't think you can carry this right now.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_705,Does this look all right?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_706,That was a lovely exchange.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_707,Then we have a deal.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_708,Did you bring me anything nice?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_709,What are you going to give me?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_710,Is this right?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_711,"So, this is what you want to give me?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_712,"All right, got it. Thank you."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_713,It's a good thing I asked you.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_714,See you next time.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_715,Come again sometime!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_716,Mornin'. What can I get you?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_717,"Hm ... You've got a bunch on your hands, huh?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_718,"Well, you're sure up late."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_719,Did you need me for something?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_720,"Sure, I've got time to hear you out, if it's important."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_721,Is there something I can help you with?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_722,Find anything you can trade for?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_723,Have you spotted anything you want?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_724,Just the one?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_725,How many would you like?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_726,"Sorry, that's not happening."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_727,"Start by reorganizing your stuff, all right?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_728,All settled now?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_729,"Yep, that was a good exchange."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_730,I'm glad we were both in agreement there.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_731,I don't suppose you've got something for me?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_732,Well? Are you going to show me soon?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_733,Are you sure?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_734,"You stopped by to give me this, right?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_735,"Thanks, I've been wanting this for a while."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_736,Looks like I was right to rely on a human.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_737,Stop by again some time.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_738,Don't push yourself too hard.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_739,You're up awfully early for a human. Was there something you needed?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_740,Hello there. Is there something I can help you with?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_741,"You're working hard well into the night, I see."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_742,"Goodness, what is it?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_743,Is there anything I can do for you?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_744,"I'll hear you out, within reason."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_745,This is everything I have.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_746,This is about what I have to trade.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_747,How many were you thinking of getting?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_748,How many would you care for?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_749,It isn't like I'm just giving these away.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_750,How about getting your things in order first?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_751,Is this all right?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_752,"Let's both take good care of these things, hm?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_753,I'm always happy to arrange trades like these.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_754,Is that possibly what I asked for?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_755,"In that case, would you mind letting me get a look?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_756,Would it be all right for me to have this?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_757,"I can consider this delivered, right?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_758,"Good, that's great. I'll have to get your help again sometime."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_759,"My, you humans are something else. I'm quite impressed."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_760,Please do visit another time.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_761,Take care not to stretch yourself too thin.

STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_768,So? See anything you want?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_769,"Pretty incredible spread, huh?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_770,D'you want one? Or ... every last one?!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_771,"As many as you can carry, right?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_772,Nope! You can't have this!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_773,"Can't, 'cause you'll drop it!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_774,So? Are you okay with this trade?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_775,Great! Pleasure doing business with ya!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_776,Smiles all around!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_777,Oh! Did you find that thing I wanted?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_778,"What've you got? What's it gonna be? Ooooh, I can't wait!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_779,You mean it? I can have this? Really?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_780,"Hey, you're giving this to me, right?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_781,Yaaaaay! Best day ever!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_782,Yaaaaay! Thanks a bunch!

STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_799,"Happy, happy! I got. What I wanted."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_800,Show me. What you have.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_801,Is this what. I asked for? Please. Let me see.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_802,I will take this. Is that. Okay?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_803,I have. No objection. Is this trade. Okay?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_804,So dependable. You are. Very skilled.

STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_826,"This, I can have?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_827,"Much appreciated, this is."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_828,"What I wanted, this is."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_829,"Again sometime, see you."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_830,"Prepare nice things, I shall."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_831,I should get changed.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_832,Not bad at all.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_833,I think this looks good.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_834,The little things can really make an outfit.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_835,You think I should add this on?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_836,Changing how it looks doesn't make it stronger?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_837,I don't care how it looks as long as I can shoot stuff with it.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_838,Huh? Where'd you go?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_839,"Hm? ... Oh, well. Whatever."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_840,Was that an earthquake?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_841,Are you trying to make a poor girl toss her cookies?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_842,"You really don't get the concept of personal space, huh?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_843,This is WAY too close. Doesn't it bother you?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_844,... Is everything okay? You're awfully far away.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_845,Could you come a little closer? All this shouting is wearing me out.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_846,Did you leave? Ah well.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_847,"Hey, are you listening?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_848,You're going to pick an outfit for me? Can't wait to see how it looks.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_849,Not bad. I like it.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_850,"Hm, so this is how it turned out. ... It's not bad."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_851,"Whatever you do, make sure it's not too heavy, okay?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_852,I don't think I'll mind this.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_853,It feels like a whole new weapon!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_854,"What's the point of changing how it looks, anyway?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_855,Hm? Are you trying to hide or something?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_856,Uh ... Now what?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_857,"Whoa, there. You know suddenly jostling someone around is dangerous, right?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_858,There's no way you're going to make me dizzy like that.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_859,"If you get any closer, you're going to run into me."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_860,Is there some reason you're this close?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_861,"W-wait, hang on. Aren't you kind of far away?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_862,It's pretty hard to talk when you're so far away.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_863,"It's gotten awfully quiet ... Wait, did they leave?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_864,Did they step out? Hm ... I guess I can stick around for a little longer.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_865,Fashion means everything to girls!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_866,"Oooh, this is lovely! It couldn't get any more perfect!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_867,This outfit ...! Are you some kind of fashion expert?!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_868,"Yep, even the accessories go well!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_869,This accessory is really gorgeous!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_870,"When it comes to weapons, the cuter the better!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_871,A weapon's not strong unless it's cute! Hehe.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_872,Huh? Where did you go?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_873,"Um, did you actually leave? Have I been abandoned?!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_874,Wh-whoa! H-hey! What's the big idea?!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_875,Uuugh ... My head's spinning ... I think I'm going to be sick ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_876,"U-um, what's all this about?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_877,You're super close. Oh! Do you have a secret to tell me?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_878,Huh? Why are you all the way over there?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_879,"You know, it's REALLY hard to chat when you're that far away!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_880,"... Um, was I just abandoned?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_881,"... Yep, I've been stood up. Wow, that's unbelievably harsh ..."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_882,"All right, I'll play along. Let's just get it over with."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_883,"Huh. Not bad, I guess."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_884,"Hey now, you actually picked somethin' decent."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_885,"Don't go stickin' a bunch of gaudy stuff on me, all right?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_886,"Huh, this ain't too bad."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_887,Isn't decoratin' a weapon somethin' a rich person would do?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_888,Feels like I'm swingin' a brand-new weapon around.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_889,Huh? Where'd they run off to?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_890,"Uh, where'd they go? The toilet?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_891,Whoa! What's the big idea?! Knock it off!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_892,Wh-what's goi— Urk. I-I ain't feelin' so great ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_893,You ever heard of personal space?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_894,It's gettin' hard to breathe with you this close. How about takin' a step back?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_895,"Yeesh, you sure are far away. ... Hey! You shy, or somethin'?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_896,I don't care where you are as long as you're in earshot.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_897,"Look, I don't mind bein' alone, but you could've said somethin'."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_898,Tch! Why bother callin' for someone if ya ain't gonna stick around?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_899,*Chuckle* What kind of outfit did you prepare for me?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_900,*Chuckle* This is quite a lovely choice.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_901,I'm rather pleased with this outfit.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_902,I like that you added some accessories.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_903,So? Does this suit me better?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_904,"Well, as long as it's still easy to use."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_905,Changing how it looks makes it feel different somehow.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_906,*Chuckle* Are you playing hide and seek?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_907,... What is going on?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_908,Wha?! Are YOU the one who's spinning me around?!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_909,"Eugh ... My head may not be spinning, but it does hurt a bit now."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_910,*Chuckle* Oh? Do you have a secret you wish to tell me?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_911,"Is your eyesight poor? In that case, come even closer."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_912,Er ... Are you afraid of me by any chance?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_913,"We can't really talk in secret at this distance, now can we?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_914,No matter. I don't mind having some time to myself.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_915,How about I leave you on your own next time?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_916,I-I can't wait to see my new outfit ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_917,"Wow, it's so cute!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_918,"I really, really like this outfit!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_919,U-umm ... How does it look ...?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_920,"Ehehe! This is pretty cute, too!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_921,I-is it really okay to accessorize my sword like this ...?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_922,O-oh ... This is actually pretty cool.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_923,Um ... I know you're still there.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_924,E-err ... I'm pretty sure you're hiding over there ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_925,W-wow! You can make the ground shake?!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_926,"I-I used to train for this, so ... That won't make me dizzy."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_927,"Ah, umm, well ... You might be a bit too close ..."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_928,"U-uh, ummm ... I-is something wrong?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_929,... D-do I smell bad?!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_930,I-it's okay. My eyes and ears are really good.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_931,*Yawn* ... I'm getting sleepy.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_932,I'm ... feeling a little lonely.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_933,Hmm ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_934,"Okay, hang on ..."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_935,Sure.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_936,Okay!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_937,Nope.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_938,No way!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_939,Here you go.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_940,Would this be all right?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_941,I hope this is good enough ...

STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_981,
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_982,You haven't accepted any quests.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_983,You do not have the necessary item(s).
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_984,You have no space in your container.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_985,You have items selected.<CR>Cancel anyway?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_986,"Yep, getting around is much easier when you're out under clear skies."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_987,"Oh, it's gotten nice and sunny. That'll make for easy adventuring."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_988,"Finally, clear skies! There's nothing better than a nice, sunny day."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_989,"This weather's the best for gettin' around. C'mon, now's the time for explorin'!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_990,"Sunny weather does wonders for your mood, doesn't it?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_991,Sunny days are my favorite!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_992,Looks like the clouds are rolling in. I wonder if it'll rain ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_993,"It's gotten pretty cloudy. Well, it's fine so long as it doesn't rain."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_994,"Ooh, I don't like the look of those clouds. I hope this clears up soon."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_995,"Clouds or not, weather's not gonna slow down my explorin'."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_996,"Well, those clouds are certainly an ominous color. The air feels a little more humid, too ..."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_997,"*Sniff* *Sniff* ... Hm, smells like rain. I think we might get a little wet."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_998,Rain! Oh no!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_999,"Yeesh, we're going to be soaking wet by the time we get back."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1000,"Whoa, it's really coming down! I wish I'd brought a poncho with me ..."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1001,"Rain means mud, and mud means things get slippery. It makes walkin' around a downright pain."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1002,"Goodness, it's raining. It would be nice if this cleared up soon ..."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1003,"Nooo, my hair gets so heavy when it's wet ... *sniffle* ..."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1004,"Ooh, my ears are ringing ... I don't like how loud thunder gets."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1005,"Neither the lightning nor the rain's letting up, huh? Maybe we should go take cover until it dies down."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1006,Yeeek! I hate this! Can't we stop somewhere until this blows over?!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1007,It's stormin' pretty hard. Let's find a spot to sit and wait until it dies down.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1008,"Being out in these conditions is rather dangerous. Watch your step, everyone."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1009,S-seems like we shouldn't even bother finding shelter if we're already this wet.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1010,Looks like it finally stopped raining! That really was lousy weather ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1011,"Good, I think it'll stay like this for a while. We should get moving while we can."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1012,"Finally! It's not raining anymore! Seriously, that was NOT a good time ..."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1013,"... After the rain comes that stiflin' humidity. That's way worse, in my book."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1014,"Thank goodness, the rain seems to have let up. It should stay like this for some time."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1015,"I really like the sky after it rains, but I'd rather change out of these wet clothes."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1016,"Fog, huh ...? The lower visibility might be a bit dangerous."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1017,"Fog's rolled in. Watch out for sneak attacks, everyone."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1018,Whoa! It's super foggy. I'm a little worried that monsters are going to pop out of nowhere ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1019,"Tch, fog. This is way more dangerous than trekkin' through rain or storms."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1020,Perhaps we should stay put? Moving about in the fog can be quite perilous.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1021,I'm okay with a bit of fog.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1023,"That caught your eye, did it? I should've known!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1024,Thanks! Is there anything else you'd like?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1025,You have sharp eyes!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1026,"Amazing, thanks. Was there anything else you wanted?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1027,"Ooh, you picked a really good one!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1028,"Great, all right! Were you looking for anything else?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1029,Nice! You've got a really good eye for these things!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1030,Thank you. Did you want to trade for anything else?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1031,"That, my friend, is an excellent pick."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1032,Thanks! Did you need anything else?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1033,"Goodness, what a fine choice."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1034,Thank you very much. Was there anything else you required?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1035,You've come across something pretty impressive!
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1036,Thanks a bunch! Was there anything else?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1037,"Oh, that's a solid choice."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1038,Thank you very much. Was that everything you were looking for?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1039,"Ooh, I see. That's a splendid choice."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1040,Thank you. Did you need anything else?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1041,"Good, good. That one is. Very nice."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1042,"Thank you, thank you. Do you need. Anything else?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1043,"A nice choice, that one is. A good eye, you have."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1044,"Your business, I thank you for. Something else, you need?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1045,I should've known you'd go for that. Great choice.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1046,Thanks. Is there anything else you need?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1047,I should've known you'd go for that. Great choice.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1048,Thanks. Is there anything else you need?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1049,"Goodness, you have quite the eye."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1050,"Thank you. Was there anything else, or are you all good?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1051,"Goodness, you have quite the eye."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1052,"Thank you. Was there anything else, or are you all good?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1053,"Hmm, you have keen eyes."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1054,Thank you. Is that everything?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1055,You're certainly a human with an eye for quality.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1056,Is that enough? Did you want to see anything else?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1057,"Yes, yes! It's gooood stuff!"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1058,"Thanks a bunch! Buuuuut, don't you want to take another look?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1059,You are. Amazing. That is also. Amazing.
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1060,"Thank you, human. Will you look at. Anything else?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1061,"A fine thing, you have chosen."
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1062,"Sincerely thankful, I am. View anything else, will you?"
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1063,Hm?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1064,This is ...
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1065,What's this?
STR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_1066,*Cough* *Cough*
STR_SUBTITLES_000,Hya!

STR_SUBTITLES_166,Combo strike!!
STR_SUBTITLES_167,I'm not done!

STR_SUBTITLES_170,I won't stop!!
STR_SUBTITLES_171,Take this!!
STR_SUBTITLES_172,How's this!?
STR_SUBTITLES_173,I'll crush you!!
STR_SUBTITLES_174,You like that?!
STR_SUBTITLES_175,Absolutely shocking!
STR_SUBTITLES_176,This one's tough!
STR_SUBTITLES_177,It's not over yet!
STR_SUBTITLES_178,You want to tingle?!
STR_SUBTITLES_179,Lightning strike!!
STR_SUBTITLES_180,It's strong!!
STR_SUBTITLES_181,Hybrid attack!
STR_SUBTITLES_182,Back off!!
STR_SUBTITLES_183,Take that and that!!
STR_SUBTITLES_184,You can't stop it!
STR_SUBTITLES_185,You're finished!!
STR_SUBTITLES_186,I'll finish it.
STR_SUBTITLES_187,I feel the strength!
STR_SUBTITLES_188,I'll slice you up!
STR_SUBTITLES_189,Can you take this?
STR_SUBTITLES_190,This is a big one!!
STR_SUBTITLES_191,Take thiiiis!!
STR_SUBTITLES_192,You like that?!
STR_SUBTITLES_193,"Power, yes!"
STR_SUBTITLES_194,I'll take it!!
STR_SUBTITLES_195,Not even hard.
STR_SUBTITLES_196,Give it to me!
STR_SUBTITLES_197,Don't mind if I do!
STR_SUBTITLES_198,Wither!!
STR_SUBTITLES_199,"Not coming, then I will!"
STR_SUBTITLES_200,"Here I go, take this!"
STR_SUBTITLES_201,Burst!!
STR_SUBTITLES_202,Perfect opportunity!
STR_SUBTITLES_203,"Heh, can you withstand this?"
STR_SUBTITLES_204,Howling earth!!

STR_SUBTITLES_408,I'll make a weak point!
STR_SUBTITLES_409,You'll be wide open!
STR_SUBTITLES_410,Your armor will melt!
STR_SUBTITLES_411,Get ready to attack!!
STR_SUBTITLES_412,Calm down a bit.
STR_SUBTITLES_413,It won't do to rush.
STR_SUBTITLES_414,What an impatient wretch.
STR_SUBTITLES_415,You're testing my patience!
STR_SUBTITLES_416,I'll slow you down!
STR_SUBTITLES_417,Why not take a load off?

STR_SUBTITLES_500,Burn!!
STR_SUBTITLES_501,Perish in lightning!!
STR_SUBTITLES_502,Lightning struck!
STR_SUBTITLES_503,Can you take this?
STR_SUBTITLES_504,This is no normal ice!

STR_SUBTITLES_611,This should do!
STR_SUBTITLES_612,This will do it!
STR_SUBTITLES_613,I will finish it!
STR_SUBTITLES_614,Did you enjoy that?
STR_SUBTITLES_615,I shall dance for you.
STR_SUBTITLES_616,The dance of combat.
STR_SUBTITLES_617,Mind the edges.
STR_SUBTITLES_618,They are very sharp.
STR_SUBTITLES_619,Go!
STR_SUBTITLES_620,I will not relent!
STR_SUBTITLES_621,This one will hurt!
STR_SUBTITLES_622,Strike true!
STR_SUBTITLES_623,What about this?!
STR_SUBTITLES_624,This should do!!
STR_SUBTITLES_625,Shower of light.
STR_SUBTITLES_626,Doesn't it look like snow?
STR_SUBTITLES_627,Why don't you look closer?
STR_SUBTITLES_628,How about a bit more?
STR_SUBTITLES_629,"This time, with more style!"
STR_SUBTITLES_630,"Be careful, this will be intense!"
STR_SUBTITLES_631,Slice!
STR_SUBTITLES_632,I am also capable of this.
STR_SUBTITLES_633,It is not over yet.
STR_SUBTITLES_634,"My dance has quite the edge, no?"
STR_SUBTITLES_635,The finale!!
STR_SUBTITLES_636,Encore!
STR_SUBTITLES_637,Fly!
STR_SUBTITLES_638,This should do!
STR_SUBTITLES_639,And take one of these as well.
STR_SUBTITLES_640,Are you intrigued?
STR_SUBTITLES_641,"This is it, it's over!!"
STR_SUBTITLES_642,Do not look away until the end.
STR_SUBTITLES_643,Fans can even do this!
STR_SUBTITLES_644,Make sure not to cut yourself!
STR_SUBTITLES_645,How about a skewer?
STR_SUBTITLES_646,I will do more than cut you.
STR_SUBTITLES_647,The finish will be extravagant.
STR_SUBTITLES_648,"Exploding blossom, bloom."
STR_SUBTITLES_649,Do not think this an ordinary fan.
STR_SUBTITLES_650,I can chain into the next attack.
STR_SUBTITLES_651,Gaze upon my storm of light.
STR_SUBTITLES_652,Fly and dance!!
STR_SUBTITLES_653,"Ferocious, relentless! Storm!!"
STR_SUBTITLES_654,My fan shows no mercy!
STR_SUBTITLES_655,Ha!!
STR_SUBTITLES_656,I can keep going!
STR_SUBTITLES_657,"Everyone, fight with your all!"
STR_SUBTITLES_658,A miraculous dance. It's quite effective.
STR_SUBTITLES_659,We attack together!
STR_SUBTITLES_660,Spread wide and go at once!!
STR_SUBTITLES_661,How about a taste of spring?
STR_SUBTITLES_662,Oh? Does it not meet your liking?
STR_SUBTITLES_663,Then perhaps you would prefer winter?!
STR_SUBTITLES_664,I shall give you the winter moon. Here you go!!
STR_SUBTITLES_665,Infinity Phantom Dance!!
STR_SUBTITLES_666,Ha!
STR_SUBTITLES_667,Huh!

STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_EXPLAIN_225,"All living things, including humans, experience negative mental effects when exposed to large amounts of mana. But why isn't this true for the Alber? Despite numerous studies on the matter, the reason has yet to be discovered. However, I have heard an interesting claim. Supposedly, places with a high concentration of mana are somewhat calming to them. ""Somewhat calming."" Hah, I'm sure I'd get quite the earful if I tried to present such a vague conclusion in my report ... Back to square one it is."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_EXPLAIN_226,"I heard that if you write a letter, you can express a lot of feelings. They call it a ""love letter""! So I think I'll write one. I feel sad that the Tall Ones who come here always look so mad and scary. I hope that everyone will smile, be happy, and laugh a lot!"
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_EXPLAIN_227,"How many years have I been forced to keep doing the same research since being assigned here? I'll be blunt about it, there is no way this experiment will work. If it does, I have no doubt that Aladiss's power as a nation will increase dramatically, but this is no more than a fairytale. I'm sure the higher ups know that it will take a lot more time and research to make this a possibility. Ugh, it's so depressing to think that tomorrow I'll be doing the same thing, again, and seeing the same failures, again ..."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_EXPLAIN_228,"I am aware that my subordinates are unhappy and grumbling behind my back. And I know that they should be reprimanded and reported to upper management, but I can't say I don't understand their feelings ... The Harvest Project would be a major accomplishment if it could be realized, but frankly it feels hopeless. Everybody here feels the same, myself included. Still, this is our nation's orders, so we cannot stop. Even I would be complaining if I could."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_EXPLAIN_229,"I'd love to just let it out into a Memory Vial, but if someone found it I'm sure I'd be punished severely. So I'll carve out my anger here to last for eternity! I'VE HAD IT UP TO HERE WITH THIS IMPOSSIBLE EXPERIMENT! IF THE SAME STUPID FAILURE HAPPENS AGAIN TOMORROW I'M THROWING IN MY LETTER OF RESIGNATION!"
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_EXPLAIN_230,"The mass production of homunculi is vital to the strengthening of Aladiss's military. However, although bodies can be created, souls cannot. That is why a project is in motion to create pseudo-souls by pouring mana collected by Alstahlia flowers into the soul vessels of homunculi. This dreamlike plan, which would bring prosperity to the nation through an infinite amount of homunculi soldiers without the sacrifice of even a single citizen, is called the Harvest Project."

STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_000,"It's been rumored for a while now, but it seems our country's relations with our neighbors have truly been deteriorating. The drop in trade and the rapidly rising prices of imports are both proof of this.<CR><CR>However, it is strange how some say that the number of ships entering and leaving the port has actually increased of late.<CR><CR>Whatever the case, everything is so muddled that it's hard to see the truth of it all. It might be a good idea to talk to the port officer."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_001,"A large number of ships have been coming through the port lately. While I would like to think an increase in trade would be a good thing, strangely, there are actually reports that trade is declining.<CR><CR>The purpose of their visits are always vague, such as ""transport of confidential materials"" or ""research expeditions to other countries."" Orders from up top tell me to let them through, so I do ... but is it really safe?<CR><CR>I don't know, but I'm not going to stick my nose into anything that could get me charged with treason."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_002,"Mana is an essential part of daily life. There is no one, at least not here in Aladiss, who could live their daily life without mana technology.<CR><CR>But even though it is so integral to our society, mana research is still limited to alchemists. I understand that this is unavoidable due to it requiring special powers, but isn't it inconvenient that something so widespread in our daily lives cannot be freely controlled by ordinary people?<CR><CR>That is why it is our duty to create tools and equipment that allow people to use mana technology more freely."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_003,"I cannot believe I got assigned to the damned 8th Imperial Laboratory!<CR><CR>To think that I, who graduated top of my class at the academy, would be disgraced by being stuck on the very bottom rung, EIGHTH!<CR><CR>The only work they do is meaningless, repetitive ""research"" that only serves as a way to shoo away losers slightly more skilled than the common folk to a countryside prison of a lab ...<CR><CR>I shouldn't BE here! I should be in the 1st ...<CR><CR>...<CR><CR>Well, that would be nice, but the people there are super geniuses who might be a bit out of my reach, so ...<CR><CR>...<CR><CR>The 4th—! Well, if I was at least in the 5th Imperial Laboratory ..."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_004,"I don't know if it is the 1st or 2nd Laboratory, but I heard that one of those upper institutions is researching the use of mana to beautify and rejuvenate humans.<CR><CR>While it's true that there have been recent findings that link mana to plant growth, I don't think that alone is enough to jump to human testing.<CR><CR>Is the empire rushing things? We can't even properly control the growth of plants yet ...<CR><CR>I think there will be some unfortunate sacrifices in the name of science stemming from this, but I guess if it's unavoidable, we should at least not let the information gained from them go to waste."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_005,"Because this lab also serves as a botanical garden, the public comes and goes much more often than the other labs.<CR><CR>We don't mind letting the public see the results of our research, but some people come and ask us to make them their own custom flowers. At first we refused, since our research is not about making ornamental plants, but then some of them offered to pay us quite handsomely.<CR><CR>If it's just a matter of selective breeding, it's not difficult to fulfill their requests with alchemy. This arrangement has become quite lucrative, though if the higher-ups ever find out, it would be bad ..."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_006,"The amount of mana produced from a memory is determined by the importance of the memory and the amount of information it contains. No other factors influence it. This is the conclusion made by Aladissian researchers.<CR><CR>Putting aside the ""amount"" aspect, ""importance"" is a tricky thing to determine. The level of importance is subjective, and entirely dependent on the owner of the memory. It just isn't something that can be reliably quantified ... which makes researchers weep."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_007,"A group approached us to ask if they could set up in an unused facility here. They seemed to be from the capital, so I didn't even need to ask to know that they were here for one reason or another.<CR><CR>Anyone who comes from the good life in the capital to such an inconvenient, empty countryside must have some skeletons in their closet. But they offered us enough money to look the other way, so I can't press them about it any further. Even country living has its expenses ..."

STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_011,"(ATTENTION)<CR><CR>Recently, we have received reports of some unscrupulous persons using equipment in the warehouse and then failing to return it to its original location.<CR><CR>This is not something we should have to remind you hardworking employees, but we would like to take this chance to reiterate the following:<CR><CR>""PUT THINGS BACK AFTER YOU USE THEM!""<CR><CR>This warehouse is not privately owned. It is an important facility for storing equipment under ownership of the empire. Please be mindful of the obvious and return equipment back to where it belongs."

I have to make some personal sacrifices to make things work.""<CR><CR>""What a quiet night. I haven't thought about the word 'alone' like this since I was a child.""<CR><CR>""I found her things. Now I can bury her."""
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_013,"There have been many suspicious happenings occurring within the empire as of late.<CR><CR>Any refusal to obey orders from the imperial high command, abandonment of duties, or desertion is considered treason and is subject to severe punishment.<CR><CR>To stop such acts, it has been decided that the security department will strengthen their efforts to crack down on traitorous activity.<CR><CR>In line with these measures, citizens of the empire are ordered to inform the Security Agency immediately if you have even the slightest suspicion of any perpetrators.<CR><CR>Furthermore, those who have aided or abetted traitors will also be severely punished, so we highly recommend that you report any suspicions without delay."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_014,"Nowadays, Memory Vials are inexpensive and readily available. But just a few decades ago, they were an extremely expensive information storage medium that was only used by research institutions and a small number of individuals.<CR><CR>The Memory Vials used back then had far inferior performance to those used today, and could not be easily recorded on or viewed. This meant that Memory Vials were only used to store important information.<CR><CR>In today's world, cheap and easy access to Memory Vials allows ordinary citizens to use them for recording casual conversations, diaries, complaints, and more."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_015,"Long time no talk!<CR>Is life in Auruma treating you well?<CR><CR>I bet city life is filled with new and exciting things each day, unlike here. Things are same old, same old around here, as usual. But for me personally, it feels like everything has changed.<CR><CR>Ever since you left for the capital, there's been this gaping hole where the time we spent together once was. I'll admit it makes me a little sad. I guess it's like they say, you don't know what you have until it's gone.<CR><CR>If only I could've realized it sooner, I would've told you in person that—<CR><CR>(The recording cuts off here.)"
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_016,"Ligneus is an excellent place to build an alchemy laboratory thanks to its wide tracts of land and easily gathered plant life.<CR><CR>However, alchemists who are used to living in the city are averse to moving to the countryside. This can be a problem, but when you consider the need to find land that has a stable mana presence, is close to mana pathways, and is also uninhabited ... Ligneus is not a bad choice at all.<CR><CR>Fortunately, Aladiss boasts an abundance of mana pathways that make it a relatively alchemy-friendly environment. Finding suitable land like this is just a matter of looking for it."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_017,"After extensively researching mana, the people of Aladiss came to realize that it was an almighty power that could be used in any situation.<CR><CR>Research and development efforts increased more than ever, and Aladiss began to grow larger and more powerful. During this period of growth, a disease called ""Manacholia"" broke out.<CR><CR>This disease was caused by taking in too much mana. In the process of finding a way to cure the disease, researchers discovered that memories of life are in fact the essence of mana itself."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_018,"The Ligneus region has the most abundant nature in all of Aladiss. It's a must-visit destination for anyone who's exhausted by their daily work or who wants to get away from noisy city life.<CR><CR>In the morning you can soak in the tranquil atmosphere at the Arbor Botanical Garden, take a leisurely walk along the river that flows around the forest's edge, or view the exotic landscape from atop the lighthouse, gazing at a never-ending horizon that could never be seen in the city. When you get tired, you can enjoy a fresh meal back at the settlement ...<CR><CR>It truly is a blissful experience."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_019,"Aladiss has long prospered thanks to its advances in alchemy, but we have also been fighting behind the scenes to ward off agents from other countries who wish to obtain our secrets.<CR><CR>Our Security Agency has dispatched special agents who have used their exceptional investigative skills to apprehend a number of hostile foreign actors.<CR><CR>However, there is one spy that our agents fear most.<CR><CR>His alias? Alom.<CR><CR>Alom's face, figure, real name, and everything else remain a mystery. The only lead is that he has scars on his hands.<CR><CR>Our agents extended the scope of their investigation throughout the empire in order to hunt down and capture Alom."

STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_030,"We are sinners.<CR><CR>We are guilty of the sin of creating alchemy, a force that can destroy a nation. And even worse, the irredeemable sin of knowing this and doing nothing to stop it.<CR><CR>We must never forget our sinful past.<CR><CR>We must acknowledge and accept our irredeemable sins, and dedicate our lives to atonement.<CR><CR>That is the destiny that we Welleks must bear."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_031,"How to perform the gesture of gratitude:<CR><CR>First, bring both hands in front of your abdomen. Then, form an inverted triangle with your fingers and lower your gaze.<CR><CR>In this shape, the upper points represent ""body"" and ""spirit."" The lower point, where the index fingers come together, represents ""memory.""<CR><CR>A sound body and spirit form memory, and memory in time returns to the earth.<CR><CR>For us Welleks, this is the highest expression of gratitude to another."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_032,"Although pious belief in the Harvest Deity has decreased with the development of Aladiss, there are still devout practitioners remaining throughout the country, with the Welleks being a major part.<CR><CR>Such beliefs can easily take root in those of us who have lived in a land as blessed with mana as Aladiss.<CR><CR>As one of the important elements that has shaped Aladiss, I believe this culture should be preserved so as not to be lost to time."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_033,"All living things have a ""soul vessel.""<CR><CR>This can be understood as a conceptual organ that accumulates mana corresponding to its capacity, forming an organism's soul. <CR><CR>When an organism dies, their soul vessel disappears, and the soul itself returns to the earth in its original mana form.<CR><CR>The mana within a soul vessel ebbs and flows throughout the course of one's life. This is sometimes described as one's spiritual power.<CR><CR>The soul vessel is incredibly fragile. It can become easily damaged if it takes on more mana than it can hold. Such a case is said to have a harmful effect on the psyche."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_034,"The creature known as the Puni is a type of monster that can be found not only in Aladiss, but all around the world.<CR><CR>The ecology of this creature is a subject of interest to researchers worldwide, with numerous studies throughout history dedicated to it and its ability to live in practically any environment.<CR><CR>The most significant discovery from said studies is as follows:<CR><CR>""An unfathomable organism that is beyond our understanding. Therefore, it is believed that any further research will be a waste of time and effort."""
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_035,"The following is an account of the discoveries made from examining the inside of the observatory:<CR><CR>The original owner appears to have been gone for a long time, but the impressive equipment they used is still intact and accounted for.<CR><CR>After only a cursory check, it seems like everything can still be used as long as it's all properly serviced.<CR><CR>This place is more than good enough to use as a temporary base."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_036,"Orders from the top are absolute, but once again we've been instructed to do a study that will eat up a lot of time and is unlikely to yield any results.<CR><CR>I get it. Even if we don't get results now, the information we gather will be used towards future efforts to do so.<CR><CR>Those who'll use those findings in the future will be happy, but those of us who are actually doing the legwork sure won't.<CR><CR>We became researchers in order to pursue the truth, but all we're doing is setting the stage for others to do so in the future.<CR><CR>Aladiss may be called an ideal land and a paradise, but for us researchers it's the exact opposite."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_037,"All types of equipment are only guaranteed to be safe for their intended use.<CR><CR>The amount of mana required to operate each piece of equipment varies, and the greater the amount of mana used, the more difficult it is to control.<CR><CR>For this reason, all equipment must only be operated by an individual with an operator's license, or in the presence of another who holds said license.<CR><CR>If any equipment is used without observing these rules of operation, there is a risk of a major accident. If such a situation is discovered, employees should be aware that disciplinary action will be taken."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_038,"The workplace here is demanding and has lots of quotas ...<CR><CR>The other day a few people quit and the rest of us had to pick up their work, yet the quotas still keep going up daily.<CR><CR>And of course, if we were to say anything, we'd surely be fired.<CR><CR>It's a tough job, but the pay is good and the benefits ensure that I can provide a stable life for my family.<CR><CR>I mean, even if you don't make quota, as long as you can make it through getting yelled at by the bosses and apologizing, you'll still have your job.<CR><CR>Thinking about it like that, it might just be its own kind of heaven in a way."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_039,"There have been many reported cases of organisms suffering from physical and mental problems when exposed to high concentrations of mana.<CR><CR>Research has shown that the cause of these symptoms is overexposure to mana, where the soul vessel is damaged due to an excess influx of mana.<CR><CR>Researchers have named this phenomenon Manacholia, and have officially recognized it as a medical condition."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_040,"In order to perform alchemy, several conditions must be met.<CR><CR>The first is that one must possess the innate talent required to perform alchemy.<CR><CR>Next is the necessity of a proper environment for nurturing this talent, and lastly the resources to actually perform it.<CR><CR>There are likely many people in the world who have the talent for alchemy, but due to lacking the latter two conditions, cannot progress to the point of being able to use it.<CR><CR>Fortunately, Aladiss was blessed with all of the necessary conditions, which has allowed the empire to flourish and reach an all-new level of development."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_041,"I thought back on my recent visit to the Alber settlement.<CR><CR>They love human food, so I gave them some of the sweets I had brought with me.<CR><CR>But what they enjoyed the most was a simple dish of fried meat and vegetables that I cooked right in front of them.<CR><CR>They gazed at the food with sparkling eyes as it cooked and gulped it down as soon as it was ready.<CR><CR>A home-cooked meal prepared right before their eyes might just be their favorite treat."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_042,"(BREAKING NEWS)<CR><CR>A battle between Aladissian Navy ships and a neighboring fleet occurred recently on the front line deep in the Auruma Sea.<CR><CR>The battle lasted nearly half a day, and ended in victory for our Aladissian Navy. It was announced that efforts are currently underway to rescue the injured and capture remaining enemy ships.<CR><CR>The ships involved in the skirmish are of unknown nationality, and are believed to belong to a multinational coalition fleet."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_043,"Magic is a technique that uses mana produced by a soul that has accumulated memories.<CR><CR>There is a limit to the total amount of mana that can be stored in a soul, which means that the phenomena that can be conjured are also limited.<CR><CR>Since mana is one's life force, there are unconscious limits to its use. While it is possible to loosen these limits through training, it inevitably leads to tremendous physical fatigue.<CR><CR>Even factoring in such training, the amount of mana that can be accumulated in the body is not enough to produce any major phenomena."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_044,"Alchemy is a technique that uses mana located outside of the body. It is the art of creating new objects by manipulating the mana that exists in one's surroundings.<CR><CR>The ability to manipulate mana, as well as the total amount of mana that can be handled, is determined by innate talent. However, since the mana outside one's body is theoretically infinite, there are no limits to its potential.<CR><CR>Alchemy can therefore produce phenomena that far transcend magic."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_045,"The Alstahlia is a unique flower that can only grow on land with ample mana.<CR><CR>The flower's main source of nutrients comes from the mana present in its surroundings, which it absorbs in order to grow.<CR><CR>When placed in an area that lacks mana, it will die within a few days.<CR><CR>A research institute once conducted an experiment having the flower absorb artificial mana, but it apparently ended in failure.<CR><CR>Artificial growth would likely require extremely close management of mana levels ..."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_046,"Last night, she came to me in a dream ... my beloved wife.<CR><CR>It's been ten years since she left this world, but I can still remember her as if it were yesterday.<CR><CR>The first time we went on a trip together, when you smiled as we gazed excitedly out at the sea from atop the lighthouse.<CR><CR>At the Alber settlement, you loved the Alber as if they were your own children, happily serving them home-cooked food.<CR><CR>Even though we never had children of our own, we were able to create so many great, great memories together ...<CR><CR>I can't wait to see your smile again."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_047,"The disease caused by excessive mana intake was solved by alchemists, who developed a cure as well as preventative medicines.<CR><CR>With the dangers of mana drastically reduced, plans to use more mana to develop the country began in earnest.<CR><CR>The Aladiss that once feared the pressure of neighboring countries was no longer, and the glorious and everlasting technological superpower of our time, the Aladissian Empire, was established."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_048,"This is my first time in the Sivash region, and I guess it's not a good place for sightseeing.<CR><CR>Not too surprising considering this is a residential area with no famous tourist attractions.<CR><CR>While there are some decent places to visit, such as grand temples, observatories and other facilities, it just doesn't feel like enough ...<CR><CR>Putting sightseeing aside, I think if you want to live in a reasonably well-developed, quiet area, this would be a good place."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_049,"When intelligence came in that Alom, having infiltrated from Ligneus, was now hiding out in Sivash, the investigators sprang into action.<CR><CR>They looked into those who had recently moved to the area and zeroed in on a teacher at the academy.<CR><CR>Ultimately, while he was indeed an immigrant from another country, he had entered the country through the proper channels.<CR><CR>As if to mock them, once again a spy believed to be Alom stole documents from a research institute.<CR><CR>It would seem that the other side was several steps ahead ..."

STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_062,"The schedule for His Majesty the Emperor's inspection of Auruma has been finalized.<CR><CR>Traffic restrictions will be in place for the few days coinciding with His Majesty's visit, so please bear this in mind when using transportation.<CR><CR>Please note that the current schedule is subject to change at any time depending on the circumstances of His Majesty's stay."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_063,"March 22nd - Core Management Officer, Callias:<CR>Core condition, active.<CR><CR>There was a temporary rise in core temperature just after midday, but it was returned to normal by optimizing the mana levels.<CR><CR>March 23rd - Core Management Officer, Revan:<CR>Core condition, unstable.<CR><CR>There was a problem that arose from the recent optimization and the unstable state lasted for a day, but was successfully resolved.<CR><CR>... Callias, you owe me one."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_064,"March 22nd - Core Maintenance Worker, Miron:<CR>Performed work to optimize mana levels following an increase in core temperature.<CR><CR>March 23rd - Core Maintenance Worker, Pells:<CR>Performed work to optimize mana levels following a decrease in core temperature. It seems mana optimization work was carried out in two places, which caused the mana levels to decrease more than necessary.<CR><CR>March 24th - Core Maintenance Worker, Miron:<CR>Transposing furnace was forcefully shut down due to core meltdown. Cause under investigation."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_065,"A plan has been drawn up for the mass production of general-purpose humanoid mutants, which would solve the problem of procuring candidates with the right attributes to become mutants.<CR><CR>The plan will be based on the Neru, and will proceed with the goal of producing monsters similar to them.<CR><CR>However, as long as they are based on monsters, the issue of intelligence is sure to be a challenge.<CR><CR>This plan is meant to supplement the chronically scarce Aladissian workforce, so it will be necessary to produce mutants with a certain degree of intelligence."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_066,"Compared to mutants, homunculi require very high level alchemy, and are terribly expensive and time-consuming to create.<CR><CR>It takes a week to produce a single one and has a low success rate. Finding a solution to this inefficiency is an urgent issue, but the technology simply isn't there yet.<CR><CR>The hole she created when she abandoned her research and left is truly immeasurable.<CR><CR>No, she is just a traitor who made the wrong choice, threw away her contributions to her country and the emperor, and ran away.<CR><CR>I will prove that the true genius is the one who always does the right thing, working faithfully for the country and the emperor."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_067,"Permission has finally been granted for the planned construction of the large steel bridge, Via Idea, which will connect Sivash and Auruma.<CR><CR>It was difficult to obtain, as this is the first time in the history of Aladiss that such a large-scale structure will be built, but now it should become much easier to travel between the two regions.<CR><CR>It is no exaggeration to say that this is all thanks to the discovery of Stirium. That metal and its property of distorting the flow of mana has significantly expanded the possibilities of what can be created through alchemy."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_068,"1. A soldier of the Aladissian Empire must serve the Country in accordance to the ideals of the Emperor.<CR><CR>2. A soldier of the Aladissian Empire must never flee from a mission, no matter how difficult it may be, and must always face it head-on.<CR><CR>3. A soldier of the Aladissian Empire must take great pride in fighting and giving their life for the Emperor, Country and People.<CR><CR>4. A soldier of the Aladissian Empire must deal strictly with those who bear ill will toward the Country, even those who are of kin."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_069,"Announcement of future work plans. <CR><CR>The R&D programs for research No. 26–75 have been frozen in consideration of profitability.<CR><CR>With the expansion of the war effort, budget and personnel will be reallocated to research No. 13's weapons R&D in anticipation of an increase in arms orders from the government.<CR><CR>In order to be prepared for the military buildup, all on-site managers should begin planning for the reallocation of personnel immediately.<CR><CR>In addition, research departments that do not fall into this category shall be downsized, redirecting their budget and personnel to No. 13."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_070,"As ordered, I have considered possible methods for utilizing mutants. <CR><CR>A single mutant alone is a powerful weapon with fighting strength equal to several hundred human soldiers, but they are considered impossible to mass-produce. <CR><CR>As such, sending them to the front lines unnecessarily should be avoided. The optimal way to use them is to send them to deadlocked battlefields in order to tip the scales in our favor. <CR><CR>It is truly unfortunate that such a weapon cannot be mass-produced. I wish there were more like Vesper with the physical strength, mental fortitude, and aptitude needed to withstand our experiments ..."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_071,"A major problem with the use of mutants has been identified. <CR><CR>While they are powerful, there is a constant danger of them going out of control.<CR><CR>To suppress this possibility, the souls of mutants are imprinted beforehand with the ""Bonds of the Soul."" This prevents them from disobeying orders from their creator, no matter how much they may want to.<CR><CR>However, the extent of its effectiveness is still uncertain, and some behaviors have been observed in a recent operation that suggest the Bonds were not effective.<CR><CR>There is definitely still room for improving the Bonds of the Soul."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_072,"In the end, I too have been given a job reassignment.<CR><CR>I've been promoted to be the director of the 5th Laboratory, but in reality, it's more of a demotion.<CR><CR>It makes sense given that I haven't been able to produce comparable results since the introduction of mutants.<CR><CR>I may not be able to overturn the reassignment order now, but if I can produce results, I'm sure I'll be able to return to the 1st Laboratory.<CR><CR>I have to produce results. No matter the sacrifice, getting results outweighs all.<CR><CR>This is Aladiss.<CR><CR>It's all for the good of the country, for the good of His Majesty the Emperor."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_073,It is worrying how young people have lost their appreciation for Mother Earth in recent years.<CR><CR>Mana is a blessing that comes from Mother Earth.<CR><CR>Aladiss has been able to use this blessing to become the empire that it is today.<CR><CR>Yet they see mana as nothing more than a fuel source.<CR><CR>I fear that this will continue until one day they incur the wrath of the Harvest Deity.
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_074,"A routine inspection of the circulator will take place on the 15th of this month. <CR><CR>Please note that the circulator will be temporarily out of service during the inspection, which may cause some inconvenience for users.<CR><CR>The circulator is an important piece of equipment that ensures the safety of the community in which we live and is maintained by the country.<CR><CR>Only persons qualified in circulator maintenance are allowed to touch this equipment.<CR><CR>Federal penalties may be imposed if any damage or abnormality is found."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_075,"Crystals that activate the latent potential of mana.<CR><CR>The development of these crystals has allowed mana to be exchanged more efficiently than ever before, and they are now used in various facilities.<CR><CR>However, the current challenge is that these crystals take a long time to produce.<CR><CR>If a researcher were to discover a way to solve this issue, they would go down in the history books of Aladiss.<CR><CR>I don't know if it can be done, but it might be interesting to chase that dream!"
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_076,"It is well known that His Majesty the Emperor is an exceptional man who has contributed greatly to the prosperity of the empire.<CR><CR>However, it is precisely this fact that gives me concern.<CR><CR>Those that stand out are a target, and this is no different for His Majesty.<CR><CR>Even now, neighboring countries are growing wary of our fast-growing country, and relations have been tense for many years.<CR><CR>It is quite possible that a major war could break out from even the smallest provocation.<CR><CR>Is His Majesty aware of this?"
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_077,"Aladiss was once a small country. It had only a few citizens and hardly any territory ... It had little, but the land was rich in nature and life was sustainable.<CR><CR>Naturally, the powers surrounding it wanted to acquire Aladiss for themselves, but despite these constant pressures, the people remained strong and led modest lives.<CR><CR>The catalyst for change in Aladiss was the culture of the Welleks, a large population of demihumans who lived there.<CR><CR>Rumors began to circulate that some among the Welleks could use mana to perform miraculous arts, and this eventually reached the ears of the government ...<CR><CR>And so marked the beginning of alchemical research in the region."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_078,"Auruma is the second largest metropolitan area after the capital.<CR><CR>Eh, I guess I don't need to be so stiff talking about it. After all, it's the city where I grew up.<CR><CR>My parents both worked, but I still remember my grandma who lived with us taking me to the park every day and sometimes buying me toys in the shopping district.<CR><CR>I also went on a field trip to visit the Mana Transposing Furnace, and I still carry around the mana activation crystal I got as a souvenir.<CR><CR>Although it's a noisy, busy city, it's a very comfortable place for me—a place where my heart feels at home."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_079,"We finally managed to corner Alom, who was hiding out in the capital. Our investigators immediately launched a raid to capture him.<CR><CR>We got him. The bona fide Alom we had been chasing. The successful capture meant our mission was finally complete.<CR><CR>Word of his end spread quickly throughout the country, and our reputation rose in turn. But was it really over?<CR><CR>Just a few days later, another experimental alchemical sample was stolen from a laboratory, apparently using Alom's methods—methods that have never been revealed to the public ..."

All the skills and knowledge of Aladiss will be gathered into a Memory Vial and placed in the hands of alchemists.<CR><CR>This would mean that one alchemist could possess the power of an entire army, ensuring the supremacy of the Aladissian Empire."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_091,"The memory transfer to a new body seems to have been successful once again.<CR><CR>In the beginning, there was concern that there might be some memory loss during the transfer, but it seems to have worked for the tenth time.<CR><CR>That said, there are still some concerns.<CR><CR>The unexplained loss of balance that has struck frequently since the seventh memory transfer is getting worse.<CR><CR>I have also been experiencing headaches and fatigue since the eighth transfer onward.<CR><CR>... As long as the transfers are successful, there will be no impact on the plan. <CR><CR>And all that I can do is carry out the plan."
STR_SCAN_GIMMICK_ALL_EXPLAIN_092,"I'm free! I finally have my freedom!<CR><CR>I don't have to care about any of the nonsense I was told during my years of working at the lab—about the ""Joy of working hard, getting results, and serving the country""!<CR><CR>Today I say goodbye to my work at the laboratory and my life in the capital.<CR><CR>I'll move to Ligneus and live a slow life in the countryside. No more being rushed or pressured. I haven't felt this good in years!<CR><CR>I'm sure even my colleagues would be happy if they could be free like me."

STR_REACTION_VOICE_000,"Let's get this started, Viktor!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_001,"Are you ready, Isla?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_002,"Good to go, Rutger?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_003,"Nina, are you locked and loaded?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_004,"All good, Lenja?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_005,I was born ready!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_006,"You bet, Isla!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_007,"Oh, please! Just who do you think you're talking to?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_008,I couldn't be more ready for a fight!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_009,"Wow, you're raring to go!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_010,"Take over for me, Viktor!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_011,"Isla, hop in!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_012,"Switch with me, Rutger!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_013,"Sorry, Nina. Would you mind?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_014,"Lenja, time to catch some mice!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_015,"No problem, just leave it to me!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_016,"Sure, I've got you!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_017,I guess I can.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_018,I'll do plenty of damage in your place!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_019,Of course! Just leave it to me!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_020,"You're nailing this, Viktor!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_021,"You're doing great, Isla!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_022,"Great work, Rutger!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_023,"Way to go, Nina!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_024,"That's the spirit, Lenja!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_025,"Thank you, Viktor!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_026,"Thanks, Isla!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_027,"Thanks for that, Rutger!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_028,"I'm really grateful for that, Nina!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_029,"Thanks a bunch, Lenja!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_030,It was no problem.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_031,It was nothing!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_032,"Viktor, are you all right?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_033,"Hang in there, Isla!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_034,"Keep it together, Rutger!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_035,"It's okay to take it easy, Nina!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_036,"Don't do anything rash, Lenja!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_037,No way! Viktor's down ...
STR_REACTION_VOICE_038,Isla!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_039,"Shoot, Rutger's gotten knocked out ..."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_040,Whoa! Did Nina just go down?!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_041,"No, Lenja! Are you okay?!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_042,That's one down!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_043,Here's our chance!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_044,Things aren't looking so good ...
STR_REACTION_VOICE_045,Something's coming.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_046,Urgh ... This really hurts ... I feel awful ...
STR_REACTION_VOICE_047,Ngh ... This might be worse than actual poison ...
STR_REACTION_VOICE_048,Ngh! What should I do ...? I can't move ...!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_049,I'm not sure that I'll be able to<CR>keep fighting in this state.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_050,Can you match my speed?
STR_REACTION_VOICE_051,"Great, this should help keep me on my feet."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_052,I'm feeling almost invincible!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_053,That boost should give me the upper hand!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_054,I'm bursting with power!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_055,Ngh ...! I'm losing strength ...?

STR_REACTION_VOICE_063,"Isla, be careful."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_064,"Don't overextend yourself, Rutger."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_065,"Nina, mind watching my back?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_066,"Are you up for this, Lenja?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_067,"And let's end it, too!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_068,Don't get too far ahead of yourself.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_069,That's what I should be saying.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_070,"Yeah, rest assured, I've got your back."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_071,All right! Let's settle this now!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_072,"Yumia, take over!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_073,"I'm counting on you, Isla!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_074,"Sorry, Rutger! I owe you one!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_075,"Nina, would you mind switching with me?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_076,"Ready to hop in, Lenja?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_077,"Don't worry, I've got you covered!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_078,It's fine! Just sit back and let<CR>your big brother do his thing!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_079,Sure thing!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_080,"Sure, you step back and take a break."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_081,"Right, I'm going in!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_082,"Nice one, Yumia!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_083,"Great job, Isla!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_084,"Not bad, Rutger!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_085,"Nina, that was awesome!"

STR_REACTION_VOICE_090,"Thank you, Nina."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_091,"Thanks for the help, Lenja."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_092,"Nah, it was nothing."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_093,"Hey, no problem!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_094,"Yumia, are you all right?!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_095,"Isla, you should fall back for now."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_096,"Rutger, don't push yourself too hard."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_097,"Nina, you can fall back."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_098,"Lenja, don't overdo it. Fall back."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_099,They got Yumia! Someone heal her!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_100,"Isla, can you hear me?! Isla!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_101,Rutger! Hold it together!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_102,Nina's collapsed?!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_103,Someone help Lenja!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_104,That's one down!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_105,"All right, this is our chance!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_106,"Ngh, this isn't looking good ..."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_107,"Watch out for enemy attacks, everyone!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_108,Guh?! I-is this poison ...?
STR_REACTION_VOICE_109,Ngh! I-I can't stay awake ...
STR_REACTION_VOICE_110,I can't move my body ... What's going on?!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_111,Ngh! I have to do something about this ...
STR_REACTION_VOICE_112,Will you be able to keep up with me?
STR_REACTION_VOICE_113,"I like to fight up close, so this is appreciated!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_114,This is very reassuring!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_115,All right! This will give me an advantage!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_116,"Amazing, I'm overflowing with power!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_117,"Ngh, my strength ..."

STR_REACTION_VOICE_126,"Rutger, you'd better take this seriously!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_127,"I've got your back, Nina!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_128,"Stay close to me, Lenja."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_129,I'm good to go whenever you are!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_130,You worry too much!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_131,"Same goes for you, Rutger!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_132,"I'll have this finished so fast,<CR>I won't get bored at all!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_133,"Let's beat them up, Lenja!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_134,"I could use a hand, Yumia!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_135,"Sorry, Viktor! I need you to take over!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_136,"Could you step in, Rutger? Pretty please!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_137,"Switch with me, Nina!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_138,"Lenja! Swap in, quick!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_139,"Okay! Stand back, Yumia!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_140,"Everything's in good hands, Viktor!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_141,Thanks for the consideration.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_142,Sure! Anytime!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_143,"It's fine, you just catch your breath!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_144,"Nice one, Yumia!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_145,"Awesome job, Viktor!"

STR_REACTION_VOICE_153,Thanks Lenja!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_154,Just leave it to me!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_155,"I'm pretty capable too, you know!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_156,"What's wrong, Yumia?!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_157,"Viktor, you've gone kind of pale ..."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_158,"Um, you're not looking so good, Rutger."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_159,"Are you sure you don't need to go sit down, Nina?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_160,"You're not looking too great, Lenja."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_161,"Hang in there, Yumia!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_162,"Oh no, Viktor!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_163,"Rutger, are you okay?!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_164,N-no way! Nina's down?!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_165,How dare you hurt Lenja!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_166,I got one!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_167,"Guys, now's the time!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_168,"Oooh, this isn't looking so good ..."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_169,"Is something coming?! Watch your backs, guys!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_170,Th-this really hurts ... I need an antidote ...
STR_REACTION_VOICE_171,I-I'm sooo sleepy ... I can barely keep my eyes open ...
STR_REACTION_VOICE_172,What the—?! My body feels like it weighs a ton!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_173,Urgh ... I don't feel so great ...
STR_REACTION_VOICE_174,Dashing around at full speed's the best!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_175,I should be able to take a few more hits now.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_176,Awesome! It's like I never even got hurt!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_177,My strength's at an all-time high!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_178,Wow! I'm feeling super-charged!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_179,H-huh? Why do I feel so weak?
STR_REACTION_VOICE_180,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_181,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_182,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_183,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_184,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_185,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_186,"You'd better not miss, Yumia!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_187,"Hey, Viktor! Don't go racing into battle on your own!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_188,"Don't go starin' off into space, Isla."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_189,"Nina, you ... uh, you just keep doin' your thing."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_190,"Make sure you keep a good eye on our opponents, Lenja."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_191,Like you even had to ask.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_192,"Too bad, I'm gonna do whatever I want!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_193,"C'mon, when am I ever not serious?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_194,"If you're the one aimin', I should be fine."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_195,"Don't worry! Once we get goin',<CR>you'll forget all about it!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_196,"Yo, Yumia! Step in for me, would ya?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_197,"Hey, Viktor! Switch places!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_198,"Hey, Isla? How'd you like to take center stage?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_199,"Nina, would you mind coverin' for me?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_200,"Could ya take over for me, Lenja?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_201,"Well, guess I gotta step in."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_202,"You're good, just go, man!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_203,"Okay, fine! Just get outta here already!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_204,"No worries, I'll eat 'em alive!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_205,"Sure, that means it's my time to shine!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_206,"Lookin' good, Yumia."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_207,"Yep, that's our Viktor."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_208,"You're actually not bad at this, Isla."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_209,"Nicely done, Nina."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_210,"Nice one, Lenja."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_211,"Thanks, Yumia. I needed that."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_212,"Sorry for botherin' ya, Viktor."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_213,"... I guess I owe you one, Isla."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_214,"Thanks for that, Nina."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_215,"Thanks, Lenja."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_216,Wasn't anythin' special.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_217,"Hey, it's no big deal!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_218,"Looks like you're havin' a tough time, Yumia."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_219,"Keep it together, Viktor!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_220,"What's the matter, Isla? You're lookin' kinda rough."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_221,"Hey, Nina! Don't you go collapsin' on us!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_222,"Hey, Lenja? Maybe you should go take a break."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_223,Tch! I told ya to watch out!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_224,"Viktor?! Ugh, now what're we gonna do?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_225,"Dammit, where're the healing items again ...?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_226,"Hang on, they actually got Nina?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_227,Lenja ...? Dammit! You guys have some nerve ...!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_228,That's one down!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_229,"This is it, guys! Let 'em have it!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_230,"Tch! Things aren't goin' so great for us, huh?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_231,Watch it! Somethin' strong's headed our way!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_232,"Tch! I'd better get some antidote, and fast ..."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_233,"Dammit, I'm feelin' too sleepy ... to stay focused ..."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_234,Dammit! I can't move ...
STR_REACTION_VOICE_235,"Dammit, what's wrong with me now?!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_236,Are you gonna be able to keep up with me?
STR_REACTION_VOICE_237,Don't go thinkin' I'll be goin' down easy!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_238,"If your wounds heal themselves,<CR>then there's nothin' to be afraid of!!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_239,Yeeeah! I'm gonna let loose!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_240,Nothing's gonna stop me now!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_241,"Ugh, I'm gettin' all weak ..."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_242,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_243,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_244,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_245,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_246,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_247,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_248,"Yumia, is your gun in fair condition?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_249,Can I entrust my back to you?
STR_REACTION_VOICE_250,"Isla, remember to stay focused."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_251,"Rutger, watch out for stray bullets."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_252,"Fear not, my gun will always be here to protect you."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_253,"Why, naturally. I'm perfectly prepared."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_254,"Of course, that goes without saying."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_255,*Chuckle* That's reassuring.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_256,"Goodness, I feel a little left out. Heheh."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_257,"That's normal. Don't worry, it will all work out."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_258,"Yumia, I must step back for a moment."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_259,"Viktor, may I leave the rest to you?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_260,"Isla, could I trouble you to step in for me?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_261,"Rutger, please hold out in place of me."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_262,"Lenja, would you mind doing me a favor?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_263,Of course not! Don't let it worry you!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_264,"Why, certainly. Whenever you'd like."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_265,"All right, you can leave the rest to me."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_266,Not at all. I'll take things from here.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_267,"As if I would refuse a request from you, Lenja."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_268,"I'd expect nothing less from you, Yumia."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_269,"Viktor, that was incredible."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_270,"Keep up the good work, Isla."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_271,"Expertly done, Rutger!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_272,"Lenja, that was spectacular!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_273,"Thank you, Yumia."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_274,"Much obliged, Viktor."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_275,"Thanks, Isla!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_276,"I always appreciate your support, Rutger."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_277,"How very kind of you, Lenja!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_278,"Oh, pay it no mind."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_279,"Why, it was nothing at all."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_280,"Yumia, you mustn't force yourself."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_281,"Viktor, I know you won't listen, but<CR>there's no need to push yourself so hard."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_282,"Isla, you know that you can always take a break, yes?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_283,"Don't put on such a brave face, Rutger. Fall back."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_284,"No, Lenja! Are you okay?!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_285,"No, not Yumia!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_286,"Stay with us, Viktor!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_287,"Isla, are you all right?!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_288,"Rutger, say something!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_289,"S-someone, please! Lenja needs healing!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_290,How many remain?
STR_REACTION_VOICE_291,Nothing will stop our attacks now!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_292,Hm. This situation is certainly not ideal ...
STR_REACTION_VOICE_293,"Everyone, be on your guard! Something approaches!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_294,Great. I've been poisoned. I better treat this soon ...
STR_REACTION_VOICE_295,"M-my goodness, I feel so sleepy ... What a bother."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_296,I c-can't move a muscle ...
STR_REACTION_VOICE_297,Nnh! ... This does not bode well.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_298,"At this speed, I'll be unstoppable!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_299,Now I can fight with slightly less reserve.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_300,A few fewer injuries to worry about.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_301,Allow me to clear the way.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_302,What an incredible surge of power!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_303,What the?! My strength is fading ...
STR_REACTION_VOICE_304,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_305,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_306,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_307,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_308,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_309,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_310,"Come on, Miss Yumia! Let's gooo!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_311,Mister Viktor! Enemies!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_312,"Miss Isla, enemies!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_313,"I-I'm a little scared, but I'll still fight!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_314,Fighting really does make me nervous ...
STR_REACTION_VOICE_315,Y-yep! I'm ready to go!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_316,Of course! No doubt about it!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_317,G-got it!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_318,I-I will! I promise!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_319,"Thank you! I just know I can count on you, Miss Nina!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_320,"Miss Yumia, switch with me, please!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_321,"Mister Viktor, could we change places?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_322,"I'm sorry, Miss Isla!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_323,"I'm leaving it to you, Mister Rutger!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_324,"Miss Nina, would you be so kind as to change places?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_325,I-I'm not a cat!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_326,Yep! Feel free to withdraw whenever you're ready!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_327,Sure thing! I'll be right there!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_328,Of course! You can count on me!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_329,Yes! I'll gladly take over for you!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_330,"W-way to go, Miss Yumia!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_331,Mister Viktor! You're so amazing!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_332,"You're so cool, Miss Isla!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_333,"Great job, Mister Rutger!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_334,"Oh, wow! Miss Nina, you're fantastic!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_335,"Thank you very much, Miss Yumia!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_336,"Y-you sure saved me, Mister Viktor."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_337,"Thank you so much, Miss Isla!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_338,"I really appreciated that, Mister Rutger!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_339,"I-I can't thank you enough, Miss Nina!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_340,Y-you can leave this t-to me!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_341,I-I can do whatever I put my mind to!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_342,M-Miss Yumia?! Are you okay?!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_343,M-Mister Viktor! Are you doing all right?
STR_REACTION_VOICE_344,"U-um, Miss Isla? You don't look so good ..."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_345,M-Mister Rutger! You're really pale!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_346,"Please don't push yourself, Miss Nina!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_347,M-Miss Yumia!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_348,"Oh no, Mister Viktor ..."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_349,"P-please wake up, Miss Isla!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_350,Not Mister Rutger ...! Wh-what do we do ...?
STR_REACTION_VOICE_351,M-Miss Nina? Are you okay?!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_352,We beat it!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_353,Everyone! Here's our big chance!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_354,"O-oh no, at this rate, we'll ..."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_355,W-watch out! Something's coming!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_356,Urgh ... I got poisoned ... I've got to do something ...
STR_REACTION_VOICE_357,"Nooo, this is no time ... to be falling asleep ..."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_358,H-huh?! Something's grabbing me ...!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_359,Wh-what's going on ...? I'm not feeling so great ...
STR_REACTION_VOICE_360,Nothing's going to stop me now!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_361,"O-okay, I think I'll be able to hang on<CR>a bit longer now ... Maybe."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_362,Okay! Time to try even harder ...!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_363,I-I can do this! I know I can!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_364,Wh-whoa! I-I'm bursting with power!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_365,Th-this is so weird ... I feel so weak ...
STR_REACTION_VOICE_366,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_367,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_368,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_369,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_370,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_372,I think we could handle this one.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_373,"First, please break though the enemy's defenses."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_374,"All right, this should work!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_375,Please use a tool that can hit the enemy's vulnerability! I'll leave the timing to you!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_376,That settles it! Attacking together to reach perfect synergy ... It really seemed to have an effect.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_377,"Though in exchange for that massive burst of power, it seems our tools are exhausted in one go."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_378,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_379,"Well then, let's give it a try!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_380,"First, we need to find the right time to switch out. Try evading the enemy attack."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_381,Perfect! Now swap with me!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_382,"There's an opening! Hehe, that was a pretty cool switch just now, right?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_383,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_384,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_385,
STR_REACTION_VOICE_386,"Watch out, this one looks like trouble!"

STR_REACTION_VOICE_389,"Yeah, this looks like a challenge."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_390,"We've got to win this, no matter what!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_391,Reinforcements?!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_392,"Guys, this one means business!<CR>One wrong step, and we're done for!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_393,We definitely can't ignore this one.<CR>Let's kick its butt!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_394,Wh-whoa! That's a lot of reinforcements!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_395,"Yeah, this looks like a challenge."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_396,"Stay sharp, guys."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_397,Just a bunch of nobodies. Let's get this over with!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_398,"This one is quite strong, so make sure to be careful."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_399,This is an enemy that we cannot allow to run free.<CR>We must defeat it.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_400,"Reinforcements?! ... Well, that certainly is unfortunate."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_401,"S-so, we're really going to face off ...<CR>against something that strong ...?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_402,"I'm scared, but ... I'm not going to run away.<CR>I'll fight until the very end!"

STR_REACTION_VOICE_471,Don't get cocky!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_472,So persistent!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_473,Yumia!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_474,Despair is my gift for you.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_475,Not good!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_476,"Oh no, everyone!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_477,Now there will be no more distractions.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_478,"Shall we continue, Alchemist?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_479,Yumia! Are you okay?
STR_REACTION_VOICE_480,Is that an Energy Core?!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_481,With this power ...!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_482,Haaaaaah!

STR_REACTION_VOICE_493,"Hehe, hahaha! Such wonderful power!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_494,Just try to stop me!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_495,Shoot them down!

STR_REACTION_VOICE_501,"Come to me, Alchemist!"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_502,Annoying alchemists!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_503,"Come, show me your power."
STR_REACTION_VOICE_504,"In the end, this is all?"
STR_REACTION_VOICE_505,I never thought you would become this strong ... Did I misjudge you?
STR_REACTION_VOICE_506,D-damned alchemists ...
STR_REACTION_VOICE_507,No ... NOOO!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_508,Simply remarkable ... You have well exceeded my expectations.
STR_REACTION_VOICE_509,This is the end!
STR_REACTION_VOICE_510,Every emotion we've felt—

STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_001,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We heard about the Village That Lives with Spirits from Wilma. The belief that mana resides within the earth means it's likely related to alchemy. If such a village exists, I'd like to visit it too."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_002,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>After consulting with Erhard on how to proceed, he recommended we secure a high vantage point. Come to think of it, there's a tower near the settlement, so we should head there and start gathering information."

STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_004,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_005,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We're now able to get inside the tower. Let's look around for places we can scan to get more information.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_006,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>After scanning inside the tower, we found out that occasionally the voices of a great number of people can be heard from what should be an uninhabited underground lake. Could it be that those aren't the voices of humans, but rather spirits? We should head to the underground lake right away."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_007,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We spent some time listening for anything at the underground lake, but couldn't make out any human voices. We even tried calling out, but there was no response. It seems a single visit isn't going to be enough to figure out what's going on. There's no point in staying here any longer, so we should head back and report to Erhard."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_008,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>When we got back to the chief, we met a man named Licht. He's apparently an expert at gathering information, so having him on board could be a really big help. Right now we're still short on information, so we'll have to wait until we know a bit more."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_009,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>The investigation has shown that there's a good chance there's a path in the Sivash region that leads to the Village That Lives with Spirits. While the exact location of this path remains unclear, it's worth taking a look."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_010,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We arrived at our destination, but there's a high cliff here that looks difficult to climb. That said, the surrounding area looks flat enough to place something fairly large, so maybe we could stack up some stairs or something to reach the top?"
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_011,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We were able to make a foothold and climb up the cliff. Now we can continue forward.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_012,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_013,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Continuing along the path, we found the ruins of an old village at the top. It's good to know we have the right place, but I wonder why they built a village on top of such a steep cliff? Let's explore the surrounding area and gather some more information for now."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_014,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>It seems that this used to be a fishing village. Since it's hidden away like a secret village, I guess that means they were self-sufficient off of their fishing business."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_015,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>When we examined the remains of the buildings, the Alber talked about curses and hatred. Could this have something to do with why the village was abandoned?"
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_016,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>At the remains on the cape, the Alber mentioned spirits. This really might have been a place where spirits were worshiped."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_017,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>That's about all the information we can gather from the remains of the fishing village. Let's report back to the chief.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_018,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>While it seems very possible that this was the Village That Lives with Spirits, the ominous words spoken by the Alber concern me. I feel that more investigation is needed. Let's head back and do some more research."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_019,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>While cleaning the village chief's house, we found a Memory Vial. Let's scan it to see if it contains any useful information."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_020,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>After scanning the Memory Vial, it became clear that this settlement once flourished thanks to a divine blessing. It seems this really was the Village That Lives with Spirits."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_021,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We cleaned up the water purification facility buried under the rubble, but didn't find anything. Let's check elsewhere."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_022,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>After finding and cleaning a place that seemed to be some kind of library, we found a Memory Vial. It appears to be broken and can't be scanned, so we'll just have to leave it be for now."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_023,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>The investigation is progressing, but we haven't found any significant leads yet. If we're going to conduct a thorough investigation from here on, we'll need to set up a base. It would be a waste not to make use of the empty beach, so let's find a good spot and establish our base there."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_024,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_025,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_026,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>The base is complete, and all the Research Team members should be able to make use of it. We might be able to gather more information if we could access the contents of the broken Memory Vial ... But what's the best thing to do right now? I've thought of several options, so let's pick one and give it a try."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_027,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We need information, and the bookshelf seems like a good place to start. Let's take a look and see if we can find any clues there."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_028,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We decided to search another spot, but it looks like the bookshelves don't hold any information. Let's continue searching elsewhere."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_029,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We arrived at a place that looks like a boathouse, but there doesn't seem to be any information here either. It might be a long shot, but let's check one more place."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_030,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Perhaps one of the Alber will know something. Let's try talking to some of the Alber in the area.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_031,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>While asking around, we found an Alber who seems to know something. However, they asked for something tasty to eat in exchange. It's quite a rare ingredient, but let's bring it to them."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_032,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Wilma might be just the person for this kind of investigation. Let's find out if she can lend a hand.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_033,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Wilma has agreed to help with the investigation, but in exchange, she wants us to take care of some monsters nearby. Time to work together and take them down."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_034,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>The investigation revealed that this village possessed amazing phenomenons known as a ""blessings."" It would be incredible if they really existed, but I'm not convinced yet. For now, let's report back to Erhard."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_035,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>According to Erhard, new facts about the village have come to light. Let's go hear what Wilma has to say as soon as possible."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_036,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR> <CR>We heard the truth about the fishing village at the base. We learned that the supposed divine blessing of the spirits was a fabrication—a collective lie orchestrated by the entire fishing village. The reason behind such a lie remains unclear, but for the time being, we're going to put a hold on any further pioneering of the fishing village."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_037,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR> <CR>Due to uncontrollable interest from relic hunters, pioneering of the fishing village has resumed. Before they arrive, let's investigate everything we can."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_038,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR> <CR>We found information about the village's facilities in the library. It seems there's a device that supplies mana to the village, but it's having some sort of trouble now. Fixing it might make the pioneering effort go a lot easier. There are several ways to do so, but I wonder which is best."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_039,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>I've found a spot where an Energy Generator could be placed. If I set one up here and get it running, the energy supply issue should be solved."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_040,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR> <CR>There was a broken device in the cleaned water purification facility. Repairing it might stop the mana from leaking, which would solve the village's supply issues. Let's prepare the necessary items for the repair."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_041,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>At our destination, we encountered monsters blocking the flow of mana. Let's defeat them and restore the flow."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_042,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>With the flow of mana restored, something might have changed. Let's explore around the fishing village."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_043,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR> <CR>When we went to the ritual site, statues that hadn't moved before suddenly sprung to life. They're probably stolen from the Aladissian Empire, but leaving them alone is dangerous, so we have to take them down. When we're ready, let's stop the golems."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_044,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>With the golems defeated, it seems there are no more threats here. Now everyone can settle here in peace. We've done what needs to be done, so let's return to the fishing village."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_045,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR> <CR>Upon returning to the fishing village, we found some of the Research Team had already arrived. The whole village is bustling with activity—it's nothing like when we first found it. We can't erase the past, but we can continue the pioneering effort so that other places will be filled with life like this as well."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_047,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Erhard asked us to help Licht with something he's investigating. It seems he's got a lead on something related to Aladissian alchemy. In that case, we'd better hurry over to where Licht is."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_048,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Licht asked us to help look into something called the ""Harvest Project."" We asked the Silva clan, but they didn't know anything beyond the name and that it seems very old. For now, we should head to the school and see if we can gather any more info."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_049,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>The abandoned academy is always so creepy, but we need to check and see if any historical records were left behind. Let's go in and search."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_050,It appears there used to be an Alchemy Department at the school. I wonder if I would've been part of that department if I had lived back then. This probably has nothing to do with our current investigation though.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_051,It seems that top students didn't have to pay tuition. I guess people had it rough no matter the era ...
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_052,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We tried gathering information around the school, but didn't find anything important. I was really hoping we would find some promising leads ... Let's just keep our eyes open until we find something new."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_053,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Wilma said that she wants to go to the Alber village to find clues about the Harvest Deity. The settlement is on the opposite shore from the northeastern cliff, so I'll make a glove for Wilma so she can use the zipline to get over."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_054,We've arrived at the location we need to cross. Let's construct a bridge for Wilma.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_055,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Wilma headed straight to the cliffs after receiving the glove. She might learn something new over there, so we should go after her."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_056,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Wilma is helping fix up the Alber settlement. It seems building up rapport with the locals is important for gathering information. I'm pretty handy when it comes to repairs myself, so why don't we get started?"
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_057,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Now that the building repairs are done, let's get to information collecting. We need to ask about not just the Harvest Project, but also about the Albers' lifestyle, which is one of Wilma's research objectives. Even if they don't know everything, getting just a clue would help a lot."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_058,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>It's pretty straightforward, but we decided to go talk to the knowledgeable Alber. Let's go meet with them as soon as possible."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_059,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>The Alber with the old book is likely to be well-informed. Let's go meet with them as soon as possible.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_060,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>The curious Alber might be willing to help. Let's go meet with them as soon as possible.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_061,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We went to go hear what the knowledgeable Alber has to say, but we ended up being tasked with fetching food in exchange. To ensure we can have a good discussion, let's make sure to bring plenty for them."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_062,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>After speaking with the book-loving Alber, we were told that we're free to investigate as we please. Let's start scanning anything that could help."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_063,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>The curious Alber requested that we bring them a variety of ingredients. If we need to bring in lots of ingredients, the ones we usually use might be good. Let's get them delivered to the Alber without delay."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_064,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We've learned that the Alber are able to relax even in manabound areas. Since we can't investigate further on our own, it's time to return and report to Wilma."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_065,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Wilma seems to have made progress on a new theory regarding the ecology of Alber. It's just a hypothesis at the moment, but I'm glad she's happy. Next, we should go investigate the old human ruins that Wilma found."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_066,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>It seems the Harvest Project was real after all, but judging by the information left behind, it never came to fruition. If it had, perhaps Aladiss would exist to this day."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_067,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Licht told us about a water storage facility. It seems that it wasn't simply for water storage, but also a testing ground of some kind. If that's true, there might be some clues left behind. Let's go investigate the water storage facility."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_068,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Upon arriving at the water storage facility, we stumbled upon an intriguing relic. It appears broken, but if I can fix it up we might be able to scan it."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_069,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We've successfully put together the tools needed for the repair. Let's scan the relic right away.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_070,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>The Harvest Project was actually a plan to mass-produce homunculi as disposable soldiers. I know we should report back to Erhard before doing anything ... but this has to be destroyed, even if we're punished for doing so."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_071,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Erhard respected our decision, but word of the Harvest Project has already begun spreading among the other team members. They're excited to hear about what it actually was. We can't possibly tell them the truth, so we need to think of a believable story ..."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_072,"We successfully destroyed the relic at the water storage facility. We made sure to thoroughly check for any remaining traces to ensure nothing was left behind. Now that we're done, we should report back to the chief."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_073,"We've erased any records of the Harvest Project, but releasing this information to the public could cause problems. We've decided to fabricate a cover story instead. We've come up with a few possible narratives, but we still need to decide on the best approach."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_074,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We decided the best approach to cover up the Harvest Project is to disguise it as a project to restore the wastelands, so planting trees should get the point across well. Let's find a good location and start planting some trees."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_075,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We decided the best approach to cover up the Harvest Project is to disguise it as a project to fight starvation. To achieve this, we not only need food, but also a storehouse to keep it in. Let's find a spacious area and build a storehouse there."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_076,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We decided the best approach to cover up the Harvest Project was to disguise it as a project to enrich the nation with wisdom. There's an old library in this region, so fixing it up should make the story more believable. Let's repair the interior and make the library usable."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_077,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Thanks to our combined efforts, we've increased plant life in the area to a certain extent. I'm still a bit worried, but it should be believable, right? Let's go report to Erhard."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_078,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We've built a storehouse capable of storing ample food. But there's nothing more I can do now. The people who live here will have to work hard to fill it with food. Time to go report to Erhard.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_079,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We've fixed up the library. Now, all the members of the Research Team can gather information here. It'll be a while until everyone hears about it, so let's go report to Erhard."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_080,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>So far, it seems our fake Harvest Project hasn't been exposed. Perhaps because of it, people on the Research Team have taken a growing interest in making things. Some have even started selling their own creations, so I should go take a look when I have the time."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_082,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>I've been told that many of the Research Team members are exhausted. Now that I think about it, no one has had much time to rest, and continuing like this could lead to problems. First, we need to find a suitable location to build a relaxation center."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_083,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Licht told us about a facility that could be a good place for a relaxation center. Though it sounds relaxation-related, we don't really have time for sightseeing right now. Let's continue searching for a suitable location."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_084,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Sure you can relax at a park, but ... We need a place where people can rest for a few days. Let's look at some other locations."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_085,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>This is place is so big, it might have had some sort of relaxation center in it in the past. But in the condition it's in now, who can tell? Let's look for some other locations."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_086,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We listened to a memory about a tourist spot. It sounds like it was really nice, so maybe it would be the perfect spot for a relaxation center. Let's look for places that connect to this station."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_087,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We made it to the tourist spot, but Licht was already there. Apparently there's an Alber settlement near here. Maybe they'll know where we could find a suitable location for a relaxation center. Let's head to the settlement."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_088,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>After exploring the area, we found a path leading to another region. This new path might take us to the Alber settlement. Let's continue along it right away."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_089,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We asked the Alber at the settlement if they would be okay with us using the old tourist spot area, and they asked what we would give them in return ... They have a point—we can't just use it for free. What should we do for them?"
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_090,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We've updated Erhard about the status of the relaxation center. It seems that his plan is to give priority to the most exhausted team members so that they can rest there on a rotating basis. While the first group of people is being selected, let's start building the relaxation center."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_091,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>The members that visited the relaxation spot don't seem much better. They still feel a lot of mental fatigue. It may be best to go see how things are in person.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_092,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_093,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_094,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_095,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>The environment may be playing a part in why the other members aren't feeling rested. I think we should try to improve the comfort of the lodging in the relaxation center.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_096,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>The relaxation center should be a lot more comfortable now. I hope everyone can have a better rest.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_097,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>The team members aren't getting any relaxation in at all. If anything, even more people are sighing now! We have to go back to the relaxation center and see what's going on over there."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_098,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>The Alber at the relaxation center talked about a hot spring that used to be around here in the past. Maybe, just maybe, if I look around I might find some way to bring it back."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_099,"We learned that there used to be a hot spring here, but it was neglected for so long that the spring water stopped flowing and the facilities fell into disrepair. If we can get the hot spring running again, it might just be the perfect way for everyone to refresh and rejuvenate."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_100,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>I was able to confirm that there's still plenty of hot water at the spring's source. With a little work, the hot spring might be reborn!"
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_101,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>After repairing the hot spring, we decided to test the waters ourselves. I'm confident this is what everyone needs. Let's wait a while and see the results."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_102,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>According to Erhard, the hot spring is a big hit. I want to go see how everyone is doing at the relaxation center."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_103,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>This hot spring used to have mana-infused properties long ago. Returning it to that state should make it better than ever. Let's install a device to generate mana and spruce up the surroundings while we're at it.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_104,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We improved the hot spring and now you can definitely feel mana flowing around it again. We decided to try it ourselves, and it feels even better than before. Let's wait a little longer and ask the chief what everyone thinks."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_105,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Everyone really likes the mana-infused hot spring. They say they can get rid of all their stress and exhaustion now. I'm sure the Alber would be overjoyed if the old tourist spot returned to its former bustling glory too.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_106,"People of various races were all happily mingling together at the relaxation center. While we originally fixed up the center to help our team recover, it's great to see the Alber are enjoying it as well."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_107,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_108,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We're finally beginning to pioneer Calumna, Aladiss's capital. I wonder what we'll find here in the heart of the empire ... We should start by investigating the administrative district to learn more about this place."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_109,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We found a facility that Nina doesn't remember. We might need to take a look around inside here.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_110,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>It seems this place was used to judge crime. The building is huge ... Does that mean there were a lot of criminals? Whatever the case, we should go report to the chief for now."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_111,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_112,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_113,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_114,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We learned the Harvest Deity religion was brought to Aladiss from a friendly nation. Wilma has decided to go research that nation once the investigation of Aladiss is done. If we happen across any information relating to it, let's be sure to tell her."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_115,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_116,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_117,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_118,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_119,"Despite our efforts, we couldn't gather any significant information on the Harvest Deity. Let's head back to headquarters and report."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_120,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Licht found out more about the Harvest Project and its true purpose of producing disposable homunculi soldiers. It seems the project wasn't successful, but the materials related to it were kept under tight security. That means there's a chance there's more left somewhere. If that's the case, we need to find and dispose of them."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_121,"We arrived at the location where we previously destroyed the relic. We won't be able to see any information as is, so we'll need to make some equipment."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_122,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_123,"After making what was needed and scanning the information, it seems there should be a place where documents are stored. We've identified a few potential locations, so let's go check them all."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_124,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_125,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_126,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_127,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>After gathering more information, we've narrowed down the location of the document storage facility. We could continue the investigation, but perhaps it's best to first report our findings so far."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_128,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Thinking about it, Licht sure does find a lot of useful information about Aladiss on his own ... Almost too much. Just who is he, anyway? Let's talk to some adventurers who've worked with him in the past."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_129,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>In order to ask about Licht, we agreed to help deliver ingredients found in this area to the adventurers. Gathering ingredients will be a breeze, so let's get going!"
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_130,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>In order to ask about Licht, we agreed to make some better weapons for the adventurers. If I use alchemy to make some weapons, they'll surely be more effective than what those adventurers are using now. I should hurry and get to work!"
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_131,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>In order to ask about Licht, we agreed to help make a simple base for the adventurers to use. Let's make some useful facilities for them!"
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_132,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>According to the information we've gathered on Licht, it seems he's headed for the water storage facility. Is Licht really after the homunculi documents? We need to go after him and get to the bottom of this."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_133,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Upon arriving at the water storage facility, we stumbled upon a section of floor that seems to trigger something. It's broken, but if I can fix it we might be able to get it to work again."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_134,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Activating the mechanism caused a hidden door to open. It was clear that something had recently been taken out from there. Could it have been documents on the homunculi? Licht may still be nearby. We have to find him!
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_135,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>I couldn't catch Licht, who indeed had the documents. He came from abroad in order to help the people of his homeland ... What do I say to that? I couldn't stop him ... We should talk to the chief and decide what to do next."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_136,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>It was decided that we would be in charge of what to do with the documents. This comes with a great deal of responsibility, as the technology that could be made with it in the wrong hands is horrifying to think about ... I need to think long and hard about what to say before we meet Licht again."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_137,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Since there's no way of confirming the truth of the matter, all we can do is decide if we believe in Licht. And we decided to do so. Licht carried out his mission without ever once attempting to harm us. I have no doubt that he's a good man."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_138,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>During the course of our pioneering efforts in Aladiss, I've felt more and more inspired to use alchemy to help others. The pioneering has made me feel like I'm growing as a person too. Wilma, Licht, I hope that everyone feels the same sense of growth as I do."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_139,"As we thought, Licht was the one who took the homunculus recipe. We tried to persuade him to return it, but we failed and he managed to escape. How should I have responded to his question? Let's head back to headquarters for now."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_140,"Erhard has ordered us to capture Licht. I haven't found an answer to his question yet, but chasing after him is our priority for now. I have a feeling about where he might be, so let's head there."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_141,"In the end, our words didn't convince Licht, and we weren't able to stop him. Those things Nina said ... Could Licht be an alchemist too? I have no idea how I'm going to report this to Erhard ..."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_142,"I lied to Erhard, reporting that we couldn't find Licht. There's a chance he already knows the truth, though. This investigation has laid bare both the dangers and allure of alchemy. As an alchemist myself, perhaps it's time for me to reflect on my role a bit."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_143,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_144,"We reported our findings to Wilma. She seemed happy that her research is moving forward. With that out of the way, next on the list is having Flammi check the Memory Vial that Wilma couldn't decipher."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_145,Scanning the Memory Vial didn't uncover anything special. Time to report back to Wilma.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_146,
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_147,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>The new Harvest Project plans are ready to go, and everyone seems to be happy with them. I'll do my best to be proactive in enriching the future too!"
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_148,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>There are a lot of monsters around here, so we've agreed to help get rid of them. Let's take down a bunch of monsters and then get permission to use the tourist spot."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_149,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>In exchange for permission to use the tourist spot, we agreed to get the Alber some things that they want. It should be somewhere in the Ligneus region."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_150,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>In exchange for permission to use the tourist spot, we agreed to make a stuffed animal for the Alber. Let's make them something super cute!"
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_151,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We cleared out the monsters and received permission to build a relaxation center where the old tourist spot used to be. The Alber sound excited to see humans gather there again. Let's go tell Erhard the good news first.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_152,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We got the items the Alber wanted and received permission to build a relaxation center where the old tourist spot used to be. The Alber sound excited to see humans gather there again. Let's go tell Erhard the good news first.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_153,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We made the stuffed animal as promised and received permission to build a relaxation center where the old tourist spot used to be. The Alber sound excited to see humans gather there again. Let's go tell Erhard the good news first.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_154,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We made a relaxation center for people to rest at. I hope all the tired team members can get some sort of respite there ... Let's go inform the chief.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_155,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>The first group to visit the relaxation center has been decided. I hope it makes everyone happy. Let's go ask about it soon.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_156,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Using the tracking device I made a while back, we set off to locate the source of the spring. If we're lucky enough that it still exists, this device should find it."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_157,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Now's the time for some good old on-foot investigation. Even if we're looking aimlessly, we should find something."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_158,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>At times like this, we should rely on the help of the other Research Team members. I'm sure we'll find some kind of clue."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_159,<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>The next location for us to search is quite the facility too. We need to be on high alert. Who knows what kind of terrifying things we might encounter.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_160,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>An organization that maintains public order, and homunculi ... What's the connection? The more we investigate, the more shrouded in mystery things become. Let's take back the information we've found so far."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_161,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>As part of our search for the place where the documents were stored, we decided to go to the imperial graveyard. It's unassuming at first glance, but that might make it the ideal place for secrets to be hidden."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_162,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>As part of our search for the place where the documents were stored, we decided to go to the commercial district. There might be some information of value in a place where so many people gathered."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_163,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We found information relating to the Harvest Project at the imperial graveyard. It seems that there were more research materials kept at the testing area. Research materials at a testing site? In that case, I know exactly where to look. Let's go report to Erhard first."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_164,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>We heard the voice of someone that sounded like they were involved in the going-ons at the water storage facility. It must have been from right before the destruction of Aladiss, when the tests were still going. This could mean that there may be more materials to be found at the test site. We should go tell the chief about this."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_165,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>Not even the other adventurers knew much about what kind of person Licht is. However, it's really bothering me that he seems to know so much about mana technology when that's not generally accessible knowledge in Eustella. It might be best to report to the chief about this."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_166,"The Ligneus region is the closest one to Eustella, and will be our foothold for pioneering work in all the other regions. First of all, we need your help with preparations to lay the initial groundwork."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_167,Ligneus is a region lush with nature. The materials we can secure here and how much we can expand our base of operations will play a major role in our future pioneering. Keep up the good work.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_168,"If the mission goes well, we may be talking about bringing more members here to Ligneus. The pioneering effort includes preparing for that possibility."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_169,"Pioneering in Ligneus is just about done, I would say. As the gateway to Aladiss, we're nearly ready to take in more people, but there's just a bit left to do. I'm counting on your help!"
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_170,"The plant life in Sivash is quite unique ... A lot of researchers and scholars will be coming here soon. In order to properly receive them, we need to get ready."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_171,"Sivash has local residents. Since we're the newcomers, we should try not to cause any trouble for them. But at the same time, we need to be able to continue our pioneering efforts."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_172,The Sivash region is expected to become a major point of transit on the way to the capital. It needs to become a safe place for people to rest and recover.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_173,"Clearing out monsters, investigating various places, preparing bases ... Thanks to you, pioneering is going well. We're very close to our mission goal. I'm counting on you to perform the finishing touches."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_174,There are many architectural remains from the past civilization in the Auruma region. I expect we may find documents related to lost history and technology. We need to prepare in order to conduct a thorough investigation.
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_175,"Sure enough, there's a lot of information waiting to be uncovered here ... But we need more hands on deck, not to mention resources. I've sent a request back to Eustella for more people. We should expand our base in the meantime."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_176,"Remains of buildings are scattered all over the place ... If we can make use of them, we would be able to handle a much larger number of personnel. Well, once we make preparations to ensure safety and general upkeep."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_177,"Being so far from Ligneus has made pioneering difficult, but the end is finally in sight. All the team members seem to have gained a lot of experience too. We have you all to thank."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_178,"The Lacuna region is more peculiar than we could have ever imagined. I wonder just where to start ... For the time being, I've compiled a list of necessary preparations based on our previous experiences."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_179,"Invisible barriers, a sterling white metropolis ... There may be unknown threats lying in wait for us. To pioneer is to carve out a path, so let's secure our safety and continue the mission."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_180,"While the threat of Basilius still remains, the Research Team will need to be cautious while going about our business. However, we can't stop now. ... This is the final region. Let's take it one step at a time."
STR_QUEST_RICH_FLAVOR_181,"Did the road to get to this point feel long to you? For me, it feels like it happened in the blink of an eye. I know this path hasn't been easy, but somehow, we've made it."

STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_000,"Someone's looking for lumber to do repairs on his leaky roof. If we have enough to spare, we should give him some."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_001,"Apparently, a bunch of rowdy monsters are blocking a road. Honestly, the sensible thing would be to take a detour, but ... I still feel a little bad for him."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_002,"Someone's going around and snatching up all the aqua ore before anyone else can get to it. Wait a second, could that be ..."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_003,"Strange monsters are afoot! And while this one's really fast, we should be able to catch up with it."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_004,"Some folks have run out of medicine. Well, that's easy enough to synthesize."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_005,Someone stumbled into a manabound area and his physical condition took a dive. We have to help him!
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_006,"A suspicious rumor from an even more suspicious person ... It's probably safe to ignore, but who could pass up an intriguing opportunity like that? Eeehehe ..."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_007,"Apparently, some monsters have decided to settle near a bridge. That's too big of a risk to leave alone."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_008,"I've been asked to gather up enough princess grass to make a hair ornament. Well, I guess that wouldn't be too much trouble."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_009,We've been surrounded by wolves! Should we fight them or make a run for it?
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_010,"Trying to be polite only got me roped into helping with some research. But ... making him angry feels like more trouble than it's worth, so I should probably go find those plants."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_011,"Someone's just dying to see a Solflower. I bet if I brought her one, it would really make her day!"
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_012,"Someone's demanding retribution against the monsters who've been chasing her. ... Personally, I feel like getting on her bad side would actually be worse than going up against a few jellyfish."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_013,"As far as rumors go, this is an interesting one. A little scary, but I still wouldn't mind checking it out ..."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_014,"Supposedly, strange noises have been coming from the assembly hall once the sun goes down. Maybe I should just pretend like I didn't hear about this one."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_015,"There isn't enough stone to finish reinforcing the base. We'll be rewarded for our efforts, so we should lend a hand."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_016,"Opening a flower shop sounds like a lovely dream. I'll definitely contribute some to that cause! ... I don't think they're going to last long enough, but still."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_017,Some jogger has found monsters popping up along his favorite route. Shouldn't he be able to handle this on his own if he's following a proper training regimen?
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_018,"Okay, yeah. That person was ... intense. But, not in a bad way! So, I'll see if I can find something that might appeal to his sensibilities."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_019,A whole pack of panthers has appeared! Let's let them know that they're not welcome here!
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_020,"I thought someone was shuffling around outside, but she's from the Research Team! Apparently, she's running low on materials, so why not help her out?"
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_021,"A monster that only comes out in the morning is causing quite a bit of trouble. I don't really want to fight monsters first thing after waking up, but I should probably take care of it."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_022,All these monsters showing up in the afternoon sure are annoying. We'd better do something about them!
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_023,"One nice thing about gathering in the morning is that it's relatively safe. Anyway, time to get started!"
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_024,"It sounds like there are some ingredients that can only be gathered in the afternoon. It might be risky with so many monsters out, but we just need to take care of them before we start gathering."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_025,There are all kinds of ingredients that can only be gathered at night. Let's watch out for monsters while we gather whatever we can find.
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_026,The monsters in manabound areas are all so ferocious. We'd better be ready for some tough fights.
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_027,"Manabound areas might be dangerous, but they're home to a unique ecosystem. Let's keep an eye out for danger while we gather some ingredients."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_028,I've never seen a monster that big. How are we supposed to beat that thing?
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_029,"You don't see that kind of monster every day. It doesn't look too strong at first glance, but we should probably think carefully about whether or not we want to fight it."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_030,"We took care of the raiding monsters, but some furniture got smashed in the process. Better go check to see how things are and fix up what I can."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_031,A member of the Research Team has asked for help exterminating some monsters. Let's report back after defeating enough.
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_032,A member of the Research Team has asked for help gathering. Let's find a good place and collect the required items.
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_033,A member of the Research Team has asked for help delivering supplies. Let's use alchemy to make what's needed.
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_034,We were asked to make some furniture. I wonder what kind we should make.
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_035,We were asked to repair some things. I wonder what will we'll need for the repairs.
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_036,Our next job is investigating some ruins. Let's prepare thoroughly before heading to the site.
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_037,"Our next job is investigating a geyser. Particles are hard to come by, so let's make sure to collect any we find."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_038,"There's a large monster nearby ... Should we run, or fight it head on?"
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_039,"We were told about a place with rare ingredients. I need them for my alchemy, so let's hurry and gather them."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_040,We were asked to craft a powerful tool. I want to make it perfect before handing it over.
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_041,We were asked to craft a rare item. Let's place a Workbench near here and make it.
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_042,"A monster ran by super close. It's dangerous to leave it roaming out there, so we should chase after it and stop it in its tracks."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_043,"A monster swooped down from the sky! We can't just ignore that, let's put a stop to it!"
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_044,"We need to fight monsters to get stronger ... Yeah, a strong monster like this one would be perfect. Let's defeat a few."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_045,There are more monsters than we expected. This could really slow down the investigation. We should clear them out while we can.
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_046,The Alber asked us to bring them some food. Let's bring enough to make them full and happy!
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_047,"The Alber asked us to defeat some monsters. I don't want them to be in harm's way, so let's defeat the monsters quickly."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_048,"There's a place in this area that a certain monster seems to like. We've been told the location, so let's head over as soon as possible."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_049,"Ingredients used for synthesis often grow in colonies around the same spot. If we find any more, we should be sure to note down their locations."
STR_QUEST_RANDOM_FLAVOR_050,"We heard about a place where a treasure is hidden. Apparently, a key is needed, but just where could it be?"

STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_000,"I accepted a request to help deliver some supplies. I'm a member of the Research Team, after all, so I'd better do my part. I'll head out as soon as I'm ready."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_001,Looks like we have to bring some supplies back. I should head back and report to the supply manager.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_002,"I was able to get everything to where it was going. I didn't really need a reward, but I'm grateful for it. Everyone on the team seems so busy. I should keep an eye out for anyone who needs help."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_003,
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_004,"I was asked to help deliver more supplies. It's a bit further away this time, but the guy seemed to have a lot on his hands. I'm sure he'd appreciate it if we delivered this quickly."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_005,"I guess he'll only be able to accept the goods after the place is all cleaned up. But looking around, that could take days. I'm sure I could help speed things up if I used some more extreme measures."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_006,All the trash is finally cleaned up. I'm sure he'll accept the delivery now.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_007,He finally took the delivery. Let's report back to the supply manager.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_008,"Boy, am I ever exhausted. That was a pretty tall order, but I'm glad we were able to complete the request. I should check in on that guy every now and again to make sure he hasn't made another big mess."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_009,
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_010,"I need to take this gift to some Neru next. I was told I could deliver it to anyone ... Talk about not being helpful. Anyway, we'd better head to the settlement."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_011,The Neru I spoke to was pretty wary about accepting something from me. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. I'm going to have to earn their trust if they're ever going to accept what I've brought them.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_012,"Okay, that should do it. Let's head back and give our report."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_013,I'm glad they finally accepted the gift. I should report back to the guy who gave me this request.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_014,"That was a bit of a handful, but it all worked out in the end. ... I wonder if this was a good idea, though."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_015,
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_016,"The Neru gave me a thank-you present to bring back. ... I'm a bit surprised the Neru are so polite, but I bet that guy's going to be glad to get something in return. I should head back and give this to him."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_017,"Looks like everyone's out chasing off monsters. I'd like to give this to the guy directly, so I should go after them and check it out."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_018,The monsters attacked and injured several people. This is no time to play delivery girl. I've got to do something about these monsters!
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_019,That takes care of those monsters. Time to deliver the return gift.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_020,"I finally managed to deliver the Neru's thank-you present. This might be the beginning of a new friendship between them. But, I'll leave that to someone else."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_021,
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_022,"I accepted a request to bring supplies to people out in the field. It's a bit of a tall order, but they must have it pretty tough out there. I've got to play my part and help them out."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_023,Everyone was really happy to get their supplies replenished. I should report back to base for now.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_024,The guy on the logistics team was really happy I managed to help everyone out. I've got to keep doing my best for everyone's sake!
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_026,"I met someone on the team who's collecting relics. I don't know what he plans to do with them, but I might as well see what I can find."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_027,I found three relics. Time to bring these back to the collector.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_028,"That guy was practically jumping with joy when I gave him the relics. I'm glad he's happy, but I still don't get what they're for. Anyway, if I run into more of them, I might as well collect them for him."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_030,"I ran into that relic collector again, and he's still obsessed with collecting them. I should bring him more of them if I happen to find any."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_031,This should be enough relics for now. I'd better bring them back to the collector.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_032,"He loved the relics I brought him, but I completely forgot to ask him why he was collecting them in the first place. I'll try to remember to ask him the next time I see him."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_034,"I can't believe he was in a place like this. But, I can understand his desire to leave something for future generations. I should help him out by collecting some more relics."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_035,"There were way more relics to collect this time around, but I managed to get all of them. I better bring these back to the collector."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_036,"I gave the relics to the collector. I don't think I'd want to research them or anything, but maybe I should take a bit more of an interest in relics from here on out."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_038,"A strong monster's blocking the way? Talk about annoying. It's not like they can just keep giving it food, either. I should go check it out."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_039,This monster does seem pretty strong. I'd better make sure I'm prepared before I take it on.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_040,"That was a pretty rough fight, but we made it out on top. I should report back to the Welleks guy."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_041,Now the road can be used freely again. I can't believe I stood up to a monster that strong. Maybe I've gotten stronger.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_043,I'm not going to let those beavers get away with messing up the fields! Time to go on a beaver hunt.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_044,"I didn't expect SO many beavers. But we've taken out enough of them by now, I bet. Better report back."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_045,I reported back to the guy who runs the fields. That's the last he'll be troubled by those beavers ... I hope.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_047,"Now the boss beaver's reared its ugly tail? We need to take it out. Once we have, we'll need to set up a fence around the fields to keep the other beavers out."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_048,"The boss beaver's down, and the fence is up. I could have prevented this if I had done a bit more investigating in the first place. Well, what's done is done. Time to report back."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_049,Looks like I can grab some produce from the fields as thanks for dealing with the beavers. I bet I can find something to use for synthesis. I should grab what I need.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_051,I need to find a missing dog. But where could she have gone?
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_052,"Phew. Thank goodness I managed to find that dog. She ran off in the direction of the research base, so I'm sure she went straight home ... right? Maybe I should go check in with her owner."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_053,"Looks like Mallon made it back to her owner safely. I'm a bit worried about her owner, but I'm sure she'll be fine ..."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_055,"I knew I had a bad feeling about that woman. Now her cats have gone and run away too. When exactly did she find the time to adopt three whole cats anyway? Well, better start looking."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_056,I've gathered some food that cats love. It's time to get down to business. Cat business.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_057,Phew. Thank goodness I was able to find all three cats. They've probably gone back to the base by now. I should go check it out.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_058,"Looks like all three cats made it home safe. I really think putting up a fence would stop this from happening again, but everyone's got their own priorities, I guess."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_060,How exactly am I supposed to look for a crow? It's not like I can fly. I guess I should start by looking for clues.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_061,I found a material that might be a clue to the crow's whereabouts. I should start by heading to a place where this can be gathered.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_062,"I thought the crow would be here, but all I found was some ore. I don't know where this is going, but I guess I'd better look around a bit more."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_063,The crow's not here either. I'm begging you. Please let me find you already.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_064,"I was able to chase off the monsters and rescue the crow. Man, I am exhausted. Better head back to base."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_065,Looks like the crow made it home safe and sound. I hope that lady teaches her crow how to stay put.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_067,"New recruits, huh? I guess that would make me their senior. Can't have a bunch of recruits sleeping on the floor. Four beds, coming up!"
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_068,I hope they like where I placed those four beds. Better report back to the team leader.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_069,Now things are ready for the new recruits. I can't wait to meet them.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_071,"Having a place where the new recruits can kick back and relax is definitely important. Wouldn't want them quitting on us, so let's go ask them what they like."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_072,"All right, I think I've got the gist of what the recruits like. Now to report back to the team leader."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_073,"Communication is important, but I'm not sure the team leader gets that. Maybe I should check in on the recruits."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_075,"Whipping up some medicine is the best way to deal with injuries. I better synthesize something and get it back to the recruit, and fast."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_076,"Okay, the medicine's ready. I should give it to the injured recruit."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_077,"Time to build an energy generator. It's not the most effective solution, but it's better than nothing."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_078,"Okay, the energy generator's in place. I should let the team leader know."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_079,That takes care of that. And I got a nice reward from the team leader. Hopefully those recruits have everything they need to do a good job now.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_081,I was given a nearly broken weapon. It's practically unusable in its current state. Better fix this thing up quickly.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_082,The weapon I fixed is as good as new. I'm sure that guy's going to be happy with the results.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_083,"With the weapon fixed up, the knights can do what they do best. Feels nice to help out the people in charge of protecting us."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_085,"He's going to collect all the broken weapons and get me to fix them? I'm not exactly thrilled at the idea, but I guess this will help out the knights. Better get to fixing."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_086,"Okay, I've fixed up all the weapons he gave me. Let's get these back to him."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_087,"I've got a bad feeling about this ... I hope I'm wrong, but maybe I should keep an eye out, just in case."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_089,"It feels pretty rotten getting used like this, but I can't just leave the knights with broken weapons. I'll make sure that these will never break again!"
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_090,"All right, these weapons are indestructible! Once I give them to that guy, I'm going to wash my hands of this whole thing."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_091,"I handed over the weapons I fixed. From now on, I'd better be a lot more careful about who I accept requests from."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_093,"Why would that guy rush off to deal with a monster like that all on his own? Well, thinking about it's not going to get me anywhere. I should hurry and try to catch up to him."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_094,Looks like I made it in time. I hope that guy learned his lesson.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_096,"That was a lot to take in. I don't get the obsession with railroads, but I might as well help get rid of the monsters."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_097,We cleared out the monsters that were blocking the tracks. I'd better go tell that guy that it's all clear.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_098,He must have walked further up the railroad tracks. What is it about them that has him so obsessed?
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_100,"So, he wants materials to make a model? I can relate to that. Making stuff is really fun. I'm sure we can find some time to help him out."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_101,"All right, that's all the materials he'll need. Time to bring this stuff back to the railroad guy."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_102,Sounds like he's going to make that model he wanted to build. I wonder how it's going to turn out. I should go check in on him again sometime.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_104,It's a shame he broke that model he built. Fixing it doesn't seem too difficult though.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_105,"There we go, the model's as good as new. I bet he'll be thrilled when I give it to him."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_106,I don't think I like anything as much as that guy likes railroads. Maybe I should try to find a hobby that excites me that much.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_108,"""You have the look of someone who appreciates an eccentric delicacy!"" What kind of look is that? Well, whatever. He's caught my interest. Let's see what delicacies we can find."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_109,Is this thing even edible? I guess we'll find out once we hand it over.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_110,He was bedridden for three whole days? That sounds less like a delicacy and more like a hazard. Oh well. He seemed happy about it. I guess that's all that matters.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_112,"That food connoisseur is as enthusiastic as ever. Well, all we have to do is find that one ingredient. Might as well see if we can spot any."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_113,"All right, we gathered enough of the ingredient he wanted. Time to bring it back to him. I feel like I'm starting to understand this whole gourmet thing a bit better ..."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_114,"I don't know if I'd go so far as to call myself a ""brilliant gourmet researcher."" Seems a bit over the top."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_116,"The ingredient he wants is inside an ore? Sounds like this one's going to be a bit tougher to find, but it could be worth looking for."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_117,I guess this does look a bit tasty. ... Wait. What am I saying? Maybe I'm the one who's been poisoned now. I'd better hand this over before I get tempted to taste it.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_118,Feels like I learned a lot about rare ingredients. Maybe I'll try cooking with them sometime. They might taste better than I expect.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_120,"There's infighting among the Neru? That's horrible. I'm not sure how much I can do, but hopefully I can be of some help."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_121,I hope that'll help reduce the damage. I should go let the Neru know.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_122,"Well, I did what they asked me to do, but it's hard to celebrate this one. I guess there's nothing more I can do aside from hope the fighting stops."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_124,That Neru wants me to make weapons for them to use. I'm going to need to think about what sort of weapons would be best.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_125,I think these weapons should last the Neru a while. I hope they like them.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_126,"They just want to protect their friends, huh? They're tough as nails, that's for sure. I feel like I could learn a thing or two from them."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_128,"I've been asked to look for a missing person. He was on a boat when he went missing, so along the coast is probably a good place to start."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_129,All that remained was a wrecked boat. I have a bad feeling about this. Better search the area and see if I can find more clues.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_130,I found even more pieces of that wrecked boat. I get the feeling I should look a bit further in.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_131,"That lost fisherman tried to escape after being attacked by monsters. We need to take care of the monsters first, then we can get him back to the village."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_132,That takes care of the monsters. Time to go let that fisherman know it's safe.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_133,"Phew. I'm glad we were able to find that lost fisherman. Sounds like he's being given different work, so hopefully there won't be any more problems."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_135,"I've been asked to help do some research on Aladissian architecture. I don't recall seeing them around, so this might be a good opportunity to learn something new."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_136,I've finished inspecting the three structures. Time to report what I've found to that architect.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_137,I feel like I learned some pretty interesting facts about Aladissian architecture. I should go talk to that architect again later and see how the recreations are going.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_139,The architect says he needs a really hard material for his design. We need to go take down some hermit crabs and collect some from them.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_140,That's enough materials for now. I wonder if that architect can use these for his design.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_141,We delivered the requested items to the architect. I'm pretty excited to see how his designs turn out. I should check in on him again later.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_143,I need to follow these blueprints exactly. But this isn't much different than building a base. Time to get to work!
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_144,Having that blueprint made construction quite simple. I hope the architect likes what I've done with the place.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_145,That does seem like a pretty sturdy design for a house now that I'm looking at it. I feel like I've learned a thing or two from building it.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_147,"One of the men on the team's been injured. I don't know what happened, but I'd better get that wound treated."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_148,"Sounds like the guy was injured by a monster. The thing sounds pretty tough, too. We should go take care of it after we're ready."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_149,"We found the monster that the guy was talking about. It doesn't seem like it's going to attack us, so let's approach it with caution."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_150,We beat that tough monster. Better go report back.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_151,"That thing was tough, but thankfully we've taken care of it now. I should be careful, though. You really never know where a tough monster could be lurking."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_153,"I'm not going to let those monsters get away with attacking the Alber. Better get over to their homes, and quick."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_154,I found the monsters the Alber were running from. Let's get this over with quickly.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_155,That takes care of the panthers. Better go let the Alber know their homes are safe.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_156,They all seemed happy to be able to go back. I guess there's nothing quite like feeling safe and cozy at home.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_158,One of the researchers asked me to help him collect the notes he dropped. What kind of monster could have scared him so badly?
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_159,Beating that crocodile seems like it'd be tough. Maybe I can find a way around it to collect the notes.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_160,"All right, the research notes are safe and sound. Time to go give them back to the researcher who lost them."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_161,"That monster was seriously scary, but I managed to get the notes safely. All's well that ends well. One day, I want to become strong enough to beat up monsters like that."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_163,"We were asked to clear out the monsters around the assembly hall. Well, more like forced to ... We've gotten a lot stronger, but the monsters here are no pushovers. We can't let our guards down."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_164,The area around the assembly hall is secure now. Time to report back.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_165,It seems the research can continue now. I wonder when my name will show up in the paper. I'm looking forward to it.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_167,"I've come across a cracked road that's impossible to pass through. The materials it's made of use energy as a connection ... What a weird setup. I don't know if the energy in the Energy Core will be enough, but I'll give it a try."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_168,"The energy I had was enough, so I was able to fix the road. There seem to be many more like it in the region. We should fix as many as we can to help out the other Research Team members."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_170,"I've been asked to take down some monsters unique to Aladiss. I've seen them a few times before, but it would help to know their weaknesses and whatnot. They may have ties to Basilius's plans, so I should fight them a few times."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_171,"I've defeated so many, but it doesn't feel like they're even alive ... Though I do feel their mana. Either way, I should report back to that biologist."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_172,"When I mentioned my suspicions that the monsters were created by an alchemist, I was surprised to be met with quick agreement. Since there's no more information at the moment, I should come back and ask again later."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_174,I received some information about the endemic species from a few days ago. I should go see what this strange specimen is exactly.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_175,I looked at the specimen ... and it doesn't seem like it moves at all. Does it run on some sort of power?
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_176,"Just who made this thing? Could it be Basilius? The city is one thing, but restoring these ..."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_177,"I checked the other specimens too, and I think I'm starting to understand what Basilius's intentions are. Time to go back to the biologist."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_178,"I returned and reported my thoughts. I don't think they looked like that before the restoration, but what does Basilius think of the inhabitants? I guess we'll have to hear the truth from him directly."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_180,"I was asked by an officer to make armor. To be honest, I'm pretty surprised, but now isn't the time to complain. For the sake of the other members, I should hurry and get it done."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_181,"I used alchemy to make the armor. To think that officer would praise me ... But I'm glad to finally be accepted. The investigation isn't over yet, so we need to keep working hard together."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_183,"I was asked to make some tools. Do they really look that cool to other people? I don't really understand the ""inner child"" thing. Well, I'd better make some good ones either way!"
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_184,"I gave him some good-quality tools. I don't know what they'll be used for, but I hope they're helpful."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_186,I've been asked to investigate the theater. I'm a little interested in what kind of shows they used to have there. I'll ask Flammi to do some scanning for me.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_187,Maybe the plays of the past weren't that different from ours ... Just what kind of performances did they put on with magic?
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_188,"This might have been used by both the theater and the government. But if there's a ""dance"" from this era, perhaps one of the dancers was an alchemist?"
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_189,This is probably one of the main character's lines. Is this something celebrating Aladiss too?
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_190,"I guess this is all that can be scanned. Although I didn't find anything groundbreaking, I should report back."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_191,"I reported everything I found out. It seems like her investigation will continue for a little while longer, so maybe I can check in for any new developments later."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_193,Starting a theater troupe ... What a nice dream. I'd like to help if I can. I'll make some prop masks with alchemy.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_194,I synthesized a Jester's Mask. I think it turned out pretty well. Time to deliver it to the theater.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_195,"I hope she can achieve her dream once the investigation is over. Once the troupe is set up, I'll definitely go see them perform."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_197,"It seems I'm going to be constructing a building based on the architectural style of the capital ... Why though? I don't know if I can meet their expectations, but I'll try to build what they want."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_198,"*Sigh* I'm glad I managed to get away. After all that ""comrade"" talk, I hope things will be okay next time we meet."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_200,"He has a point. It's very important to expand our survey base. We've had quite a lot of people join, and we need the proper facilities to support everyone."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_201,"I'm glad to be of use to everyone ... is what I thought, but it's true that we're part of that ""everyone"" as well. I hope that the other Research Team members can help us when we're in need as well."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_203,"I can't believe there's an Alber in a place like this! They don't seem to mind, but it's dangerous around here. I'll make some tools for them."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_204,"In return for our help, the Alber told us about the Alber hermit. This hermit supposedly knows everything, so maybe they know something about Basilius's plans. When we have time, we should go pay a visit."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_206,"When we arrived where the Alber hermit lives, we were suddenly attacked by monsters. It was a big surprise, but we have to defeat them in order to have our talk!"
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_207,"I have no idea what the Alber hermit was talking about. The tool they left behind seems like it could be useful, but for what exactly? What a mysterious Alber."
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_209,Viktor sure seemed fired up about something. Maybe I should hear him out.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_210,I'm going to work on practicing coordinated attacks with Viktor. Let's find a monster to test it out on.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_211,Isla is really excited about something. I should go talk to her.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_212,I'm going to work on practicing stylish combat moves with Isla. Let's find a monster to test it out on.
STR_QUEST_NORMAL_FLAVOR_213,"I was taught how to make a jar that can store Alstahlia nectar. And if it can hold nectar, it should be able to hold energy too ... Let's try it out."

No. I need to calm down. Being anxious won't solve anything. I found a way through, all I need to do is go forward."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_001,"There are a lot of monsters here. I don't even know if the others are all right. The only person I can rely on is myself. I've never been in a situation like this before, but I still have to fight. I have to find a way to join back up with them."

STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_020,"Viktor and Isla are monitoring me since everyone is cautious of alchemy and its mysterious power. I have to prove my worth here, so I just need to take things one step at a time. I should gather ingredients while heading to the atelier."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_021,"The atelier. A ruin someone left behind. The person who lived here must have been an alchemist, right? It's so perfectly suited to alchemy that I think that must be the case. Our investigation starts now ... but there are still preparations to be made. Viktor and Isla seem like they'll help out, so we should work together to get things in order."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_022,"I'm finally ready to start synthesizing. This is the first time I'll be doing it with people watching. I'm a little nervous ... I wonder what those two will think after seeing alchemy. It's a bit worrying, but all I can do now is give it a try. Alchemy is for helping others, right, Mom?"
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_023,"Manipulating mana to form recipes from memories, then using them to reconstruct real materials—that's what alchemy is. Though, even if I say that, it might not have much meaning. All I can really do is show off my stance during our missions. First, I should test the power of the Lufts with those two."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_024,"""Alchemy is taboo."" That's a given, and I understand the dangers. But it's also true that this power is necessary in order to advance the investigation. And above all ... I can't leave until I learn exactly what sort of alchemy my mother used. I don't want to leave. Now that we've done what we needed to do here, I figure it's time to go back to base."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_025,"I can often feel eyes on me when I walk around the base. I don't care what they say ... is what I told myself when I first arrived, but I can't help but get hung up on their words. But now isn't the time to be feeling down. Let's help aid the injured."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_026,"I can often feel eyes on me when I walk around the base. I don't care what they say ... is what I told myself when I first arrived, but I can't help but get hung up on their words. But now isn't the time to be feeling down. Let's help get rid of the monsters."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_027,"Several people got hurt after being suddenly attacked by monsters. At times like these, alchemy can save the day. This is a good chance to show my worth ... I think, but will I be able to do it right? I'll do what I can to help."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_028,"I made some pretty effective medicine. But the reaction it got wasn't great. I guess it won't be possible to just brush away the notion that alchemy is dangerous. Things didn't go the way I hoped, but what I need to do still hasn't changed. We should go back to the base for now."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_029,"He called himself Corleonis, but what is he after? Since he seemed to be at home in the manabound area, he's definitely not your average monster. Let's head back and make a quick report on what we've learned."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_030,"There are still many monsters lurking around the base. I'm going to help with driving them away. This is the perfect opportunity to show off the power of the tools I made. I've got to do well and show everyone the usefulness of alchemy. Once I'm done getting ready, I should head to the area the monsters are at."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_031,"We finished clearing out the monsters, but everyone was cautious of me. I guess that's just the way it's going to be for now ... I just need to keep making steady progress while doing what is asked of me. In any case, this area should be good now. Let's go back to the base."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_032,"A dragon-like monster was awaiting us. It walked on two legs and was able to speak, but more importantly, it looked absurdly strong. It turned a blind eye to us this time, but we'd better hurry back and make a report."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_033,"I understand, I get the same uneasy feeling about the unknown. If it were the other way around, I might have had my doubts about alchemy as well. But it's precisely because of those thoughts that the words the assistant said to me felt so warm. They made me feel like I could keep going. Now is a good time to talk Erhard and receive our next mission."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_034,"We tried to use the door to get into the lighthouse, but it's rusted shut. If I had a Repair Kit, I should be able to fix it. Let's look around and see if we can find what we need to make one."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_035,"Particles, remnants of memories. If gathered and combined, it's possible to create the Memory Vials needed for synthesis. If you can think of it, it can be made. All I need is an idea. In other words, it's a great chance to show off my skills. Once I'm ready, I'll get started on making one."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_036,"I can make Lehrunes now. My repertoire is still small, but if I can keep adding recipes like this, I'll be more useful to everyone than ever before. Time to quickly make some Lehrunes and head to the lighthouse once preparations are done."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_037,"Just like I thought, I was able to fix the lighthouse door, letting us inside. We still need to head up to the top, but it doesn't look like it'll be a bad climb. We'll just have to take it slow and make sure we don't fall."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_038,"We found an odd crystal while we were going up the lighthouse. Flammi said that it holds a strange kind of power, so there might be something we can use it for. Anyways, we should keep going, but also stay on the lookout for other stuff like this."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_039,"The pedestal to a broken mana circulator was all that was left at the top of the lighthouse. Since those are pathways for mana, clearing the blockage here should make the manabound area disappear ... Probably. If this goes well, it would be a huge step forward for the Research Team. This is why I came here. I need to take the utmost care."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_040,"The manabound area cleared up. I've finally made my first big contribution! I want to keep expanding the scope of the investigation just like this. According to Erhard, the Research Team's goals are largely divided into two categories: ""investigation"" and ""pioneering."" The new land made accessible after clearing the manabound area is a perfect candidate for a base. Let's get to it!"
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_041,"Erhard recognized my achievements, but many of the other members still have their doubts about me. I don't know myself if the path I'm taking will lead to any answers. But I firmly believe that nothing will happen if we don't even try to learn. For now, we should go back to the base and talk to Chief."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_042,I talked to the chief about what comes next. It seems I'm free to choose whether to head north or east. The investigation is finally starting in earnest. I need to put effort into producing more results!
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_043,"Deep inside the forest is a massive botanical garden. Judging by the flow of mana, there should be a pedestal around here, but it must be blocked by something. I don't think we'll find it right away, so it might be better to investigate the area before looking for the pedestal."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_044,"Clearing the manabound area went without a hitch ... or so we thought, but then monsters jumped out and attacked us! They looked pretty on edge too ... Something must have happened here in this forest. Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but let's keep a careful eye out while we explore."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_045,"We found Viktor and Isla's bitter nemesis—a huge monster that I absolutely can't ignore either. It's the one that caused the mana disaster! It left quickly, but there's no way we can let that monster keep roaming around. But as we are, we simply don't know enough ... Let's just calm down and report to the chief."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_046,"Following the flow of mana, we found a huge facility. Apparently, it's called the ""8th Imperial Laboratory."" Let's investigate while looking for the pedestal. We may find information on Aladiss and alchemy."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_047,"The manabound area is gone, but the flow doesn't seem to be connected to anywhere. Still, learning that is progress in and of itself. Plus, Isla found a big, sturdy material box. Judging from where we found it, it might be something good. I'll try fixing it up to see if I can open it."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_048,"Inside the box was a Memory Vial from the past civilization. We didn't get much information from it, but we learned that ""alchemists from the east"" were doing things here. Alchemy was rooted in people's everyday lives back then, and we've found some small proof of it. I feel we really lived up to the name of the Research Team today."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_049,"We reported to the chief that we cleared another manabound area and told him about our encounter with that monster. Personally, I'm particularly interested in the tool the monster was using ... That monster probably—no, definitely—has some relation to alchemy. Our next task is to investigate the ruins found to the north that may have once been used by alchemists. We should keep an eye out for that monster as we proceed."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_050,"When we arrived at the research facility, we ran into a Research Team member who had gotten there before us. Did we get our orders mixed up? But we got ours directly from the chief ... I'm not sure what's going on, but we have our orders, so we can't just leave without doing anything. Let's check inside."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_051,"There were some old books left on the shelves, but they're all in unreadable condition after sitting there for years. Part of the shelves wasn't dusty though, so maybe the still-readable documents were taken out by that member from earlier? Let's keep up the search for now."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_052,"There's a bunch of debris and broken tools scattered around, but that's nothing unusual. Let's keep up the investigation."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_053,"I found something shiny!... Or so I thought, but it was just an old coin. A collector might buy it, but that's not what we're here for ... I guess we should keep looking."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_054,"I told Viktor and Isla about how I became an alchemist. I haven't told many people about my past before. And those two don't have the best impression of alchemy either ... But still, they listened to my story. I'm grateful. Next, we should go back to the base and report on what we found in the ruins."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_055,"The chief and the team member we saw earlier were talking when we got back. It seems like he was acting on his own when we bumped into each other. Not the best use of our time ... Well, at least now we can have Flammi scan the Memory Vial he brought back."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_056,"The Memory Vial had information relating to alchemy from the past. I might be able to use this myself! I'll try a couple things out.<CR>Rutger will also be joining us from here on out ... I wonder if it'll be okay. I can already tell that he and Isla won't get along. Well, since the chief is vouching for his abilities, we'll just see how it goes."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_057,"Apparently, Rutger wants to see some alchemy. It's unexpected that he would want to see forbidden alchemy for himself. What a weir—I mean, unique kind of person he is. So it's back to the atelier we go in order to show him my alchemy."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_058,"There's a door in the atelier that just refuses to open. Rutger recklessly tried to kick it in, but he had to admit bitter defeat. He really is weir—Er, curious. After talking a bit, it was decided I'd make him a weapon. He had a lot of demands, but as long as I make something similar enough it should be fine, right?"
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_059,"I gave Rutger the weapon I made for him, and he seemed happy with it. He really is all about money ... Well, I can't say I dislike being praised. Our next destination is the Alber settlement. In what I'm guessing was his way of saying thanks, Rutger shared some information about it with us. I'd rather just have an honest ""thank you,"" but that might be expecting too much from him."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_060,"The Alber seem to be totally at home even in manabound areas. They're okay with giving us directions to the Great Tree, but in exchange they want us to help rebuild the settlement's fences. That shouldn't be too difficult. Besides, it feels nice to help someone out. Not to mention the little ones are just so adorable that I can't help but want to dote on them."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_061,"With the fence repairs all finished, the Alber told us where the secret path is. ... Honestly, if we hadn't asked, we never would've found it ourselves. Well, now that we know what we're looking for, we can set out for the Great Tree."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_062,"We made it to the secret path, but it's Alber-sized! There's no way we can fit. I can forgive the cute little Alber for their mistake, but the tree roots are too big to break. Maybe there's some way we could move them in order to slip through?"
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_063,"I had to force it, but there's a way through now! We can finally head to the Great Tree. The largest manabound area yet is spread out around here, so after making sure our energy situation is sorted, we should head out to look for the pedestal."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_064,"... The air here feels tense. Maybe it's because the mana is thick, or because there are so many monsters. Or, just maybe it's because ... Let's make sure we're fully prepared. If we're low on anything, we should head back to the atelier or base. I want to be ready for whatever may come."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_065,"Vesper. The monster's name is Vesper. His objective and how he came to be in the first place are still a mystery, but what's for certain is that he's an enemy who stands in our way. An enemy who could beat us ... No. Whatever he is, we can't back down."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_066,"A Research Team member named Nina saved us from our predicament. I thought we had Vesper cornered, but he had plenty of strength to spare. After his attention was drawn by something, he ran off ... Or rather, let us off easy. Anyways, we should hurry and get to the pedestal so we can clear the manabound area ..."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_067,"Vesper seems to be gathering particles. I knew it, he definitely has some connection to alchemy ... There might be an unknown alchemist lurking in these lands. What we learn about them may help solve the mysteries of Aladiss. Let's check around the area for any traces or clues."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_068,"There was a Memory Vial, but we didn't find any information connected to Vesper. We're going to put a pause on investigating for now. However, Nina is going to hang back and look around a little more. We need to report back to the chief about Vesper."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_069,"We're done investigating this area for now, but nothing was really solved. We still have to do something about Vesper, and I still don't know what alchemy is. The road ahead seems long. We're still grasping for clues, but we have to keep moving forward with the investigation. Now we head east. In order to reach the capital, we need to go to the next region."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_070,"My primary objective is to erase the manabound areas. Manipulating mana is something only I can do. I don't know how it'll turn out, but I just have to try my best! Being inside the manabound area is dangerous. We need to be prepared."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_071,"Isla asked me why I chose to go down the same path as my mom. A natural question. I just haven't ever talked about that with anyone before ... But if they're going to be my partners from here on out, they should know. Let's go somewhere we can talk."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_072,It looks like I managed to remove the barrier. I should be able to approach the pedestal and clear away the manabound area now.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_073,"The basic preparations for synthesis are done. Now we need to collect the necessary ingredients for making the tools. We should be able to shoot down stuff we might want from high places to collect them easily. If we don't have enough bullets, we can synthesize some more on the spot."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_074,"Okay, that should do it. Let's go back to the atelier."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_075,"The Research Team's job doesn't end at clearing the manabound areas, the land must be secured too. First off, we should build a proper base here. It looks like the materials we need have already been gathered by all the other members, so we should use them gratefully."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_076,"<CLRE>Pioneering Quest<CLNR><CR>After finishing the construction of the base, the chief gave us <CLRE>""Pioneering Plans""<CLNR>. Let's try to meet the pioneering goals and help the Research Team using these plans. As we move forward, some <CLGR>new assignments<CLNR> may come our way. I have to be willing to help out in order to prove that I can be useful."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_077,"After achieving some of the pioneering goals, I was given a new assignment by the chief. I wonder what kind of person this Wilma is ... and why did she ask for me specifically? I don't know if I can help, but I'll at least go and see what I'm needed for."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_078,"We completed a good amount of pioneering goals. For now, let's go and report to the chief."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_079,"The leader of the Welleks settlement introduced herself as Cledia. Apparently, manabound areas—the ""forbidden lands,"" as the Welleks call them—are a big deal. Let's show them that we can clear one to gain their trust."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_080,"We've proved that we can clear the manabound areas, but they're still wary of us. But it seems the chief expected this sort of situation and called in ""the perfect mediator."" Just who exactly could it be?"
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_081,"There was a little bit of trouble, but we were able to meet up with Lenja. She's the mediator, and the only Welleks on the Research Team. It's true she might be the perfect choice, but I still feel a little uneasy ... Well, now that we've shown her the way, it's time for us to return to the settlement too."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_082,"I talked one-on-one with Cledia. She told me that the Welleks reject alchemy in the strongest terms, and that I must not reveal my identity as an alchemist at any cost. This is so much more than it being a mere ""taboo."" I guess I was being naive ... I wonder what happened in the past. For now, I should go back to where everyone else is."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_083,"Our investigation has expanded into the Sivash region, and a base was set up on the front line. It was done in a short amount of time, but it has enough equipment to be called a proper base. We'll gratefully make use of it."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_084,The hunters are going to clear out the monsters in the cathedral. This could be an opportunity to help out and build trust ... Though I can't shake the feeling we're just fumbling around. We've got to prove our usefulness. Let's make quick work of these monsters.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_085,"We heard the Welleks shouting! We ran up to discover them being attacked by a giant monster. This is an emergency, we have to defeat it for them!"
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_086,"We were able to take down the monsters, and everyone is safe. ""Courtesy must be repaid."" The Welleks take pride in that mantra, and allowed us to enter the cathedral as thanks. This should be a great chance to learn more about the Welleks and the taboo they placed on alchemy."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_087,"The precursor to alchemy was something created by the Welleks. Its spread is what caused the Welleks to lose their homeland ... Telling them that it wasn't their fault would almost certainly be meaningless. The Silva now bear this ""sin"" on their shoulders. It has become their code. How do I approach this? I need time to think."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_088,"There's a kind of monster called the Neru in Sivash. Well, I say ""monster,"" but some of them can speak and have built a settlement. It seems the Welleks have been at odds with them for a long time. Armed conflict seems overboard though ... For now, let's prepare some easy-to-use bows and quivers for the Welleks."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_089,"I'm glad everyone was happy with the bows and quivers. Isla asked the Welleks about the history between them and the Neru, and they agreed to tell us. Since we're outsiders, it's important that we learn about what's going on in this area. We should ask for more details."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_090,"The reason for their animosity is the Alstahlia flower. Isla and I wondered if clearing the manabound areas would erase the root cause of the problem, but it's not so simple. The heavy weight of their memories can't be erased just like that ... They may just uphold their code more strongly than ever."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_091,"As the Welleks live in a confined area, it seems they scavenge materials from nearby ruins and gather them into one place for future use. At a glance it just looks like a junkyard ... But when the topic of searching the trash for treasure came up, Rutger's eyes lit up. I'm surprised to see his disposition change so quickly, but I guess we'll help him."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_092,"Our lucky find is some sort of transportation device, I think. If I can fix it to where it's usable, it could help our investigation! I want to get started right away, but it looks pretty advanced ... I don't think I can do it from scratch. Maybe we can find some replacement parts or something at Hermea Academy."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_093,"We found parts, but I don't know how to use them ... In that case, I wonder if I could alter them into something I can work with? I'll ask Flammi for advice as I make the parts usable."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_094,"There's been three times in my life where I've thought this might be the end for me. The first was as a little girl, when I was chasing after the flow of mana and fell off a cliff. The second was during the mana disaster. The third ... was when this thing shot off."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_095,"We've gained Cledia's trust and can finally begin our investigation in full. During our talk, Cledia called us ""a strange group."" It seems Rutger is keeping something from us. He probably won't talk about himself ... But maybe Chief can tell us what's going on."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_096,"Selling memories ... How horrific. There are alchemists out there who go beyond just manipulating mana, manipulating people's memories instead. The power I wield is truly capable of unspeakable things ... Rutger doesn't want to talk about it, but I'd really like to hear his story. Just what did he experience back then?"
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_097,"Listening to Rutger's story gave me a sinking feeling in my stomach, like I was falling into a dark pit. There might be even more people like the black market dealer Rutger met somewhere in the world. He said it doesn't involve me, but I wonder if it's okay to leave it like that ..."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_098,"Nina's hiding her intentions ...? Still, if she hadn't stepped in that one time, we'd have been in serious trouble, so I don't think she's a bad person. That said, I don't think what Rutger's saying is wrong either. Well, I'll just tuck that away in the back of my mind for now."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_099,"Lenja's gone missing?! She was supposed to go meet with the local Welleks on mediator duty, but she missed her scheduled contact time. Did something happen to her? I'm worried ... Let's go talk to the people at the settlement and see if we can follow her trail."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_100,"We couldn't figure out where Lenja went, but we did find her bag. If I can make a mana tracking tool, we might be able to figure out her location. Let's get to it."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_101,"Now that Flammi's all set up with a tracking device, we're good to go! We should be able to follow the signs Lenja left and figure out where she went. If there's anything else we need to prep, we should do it now."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_102,"We followed the trail and ended up in front of the Neru settlement. The gatekeeper told us that Lenja had indeed gone there, but that she went further west afterward. The search continues ... To the west!"
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_103,"We still haven't seen Lenja, but it does look like we're going in the right direction. There aren't any signs that she picked any flowers, so maybe she hasn't found any yet. Let's continue following her footprints."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_104,"A humanoid monster! She's clearly the same type as Vesper, too. She attacked us as soon as we found Lenja. A single glance made it clear just how dangerous she was. When she looked at me, her eyes were filled with rage ... The situation has taken a turn for the worst. We have to retreat for now."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_105,"Lenja's going to be helping us investigate from here on out. It'll be nice to have a Welleks on our side, that's for sure. It seems like that monster really hates alchemists, which makes me wonder why, but for now let's be happy that Lenja's joining us."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_106,"According to Nina, someone's been watching us, but I didn't notice at all. Well, there don't seem to be any other clues here, so we should head back to the Welleks settlement."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_107,"When we went to go give Cledia an update on the whole Lenja debacle, she told us that the humanoid monster is called Lili Borea. The Welleks warriors just went out on an excursion, but it might be best to go ask them about her right away, considering everything that's been happening."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_108,"The Welleks warriors didn't have much information about Lili Borea, but they did say that she never suddenly attacked. Does she harbor a hatred for alchemists? We should head to the Neru settlement next and see what information we can gather there."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_109,"The Neru settlement is in need of Alstahlia nectar. Getting that ready isn't an easy task, but we might be able to make a trade if an Energy Generator would do the trick. We should hurry up and negotiate with the Neru."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_110,There was a recording about Lili Borea on the Memory Vial that Laurie Nauie gave us. She was a human being who was modified by alchemy. I understand the anger in her eyes now ... Just how am I supposed to take in all of this?
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_111,"No matter how we face Lili Borea, I'd like to try and talk with her one more time. Who knows if she'll be willing to talk, but still ..."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_112,"We arrived at the observatory. The place is looking pretty run down, but there might be information about Lili Borea somewhere inside of here. First things first, I should figure out where to use this key I got."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_113,"The key was a perfect fit. At a glance, it seems to be some kind of hidden room. I wonder what sort of research the alchemists did here in the past. It doesn't seem like there are any notes or materials left behind, but I'll ask Flammi to scan the room."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_114,We found information about the alchemists who fled from the east. It seems the alchemists who couldn't stand how the country was changing because of the war fled this way. A certain Doctor Marina is cited as their leader ... I wonder if her research is still out there somewhere.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_115,"We learned about the research on mutants. It seems that in addition to the Neru, there's also a race called the Geni who were created via alchemy and used for labor. It's written that the alchemists were researching mutants, but maybe that's connected to Vesper and Lili Borea too ..."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_116,"We found a document about the ""rise in mana concentration"" that was happening in Aladiss way back when. It described the negative effects that were happening in the shadows as the empire rapidly expanded. It seems that the mana circulators were placed throughout each region as a countermeasure for this issue."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_117,"I guess that's everything I can scan here. If I put all the things we've learned together, I think I have a fairly good idea of what happened to this country. But it doesn't seem like there's any information about Lili Borea. I suppose we should call off the investigation for now and head to the Great Elevator where the Neru are based."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_118,"I thought we found Lili Borea for a second, but no, it was Corleonis, another mutant ... Just what is going on here? This one is different from Lili Borea though—he doesn't seem to wish to fight us. I don't understand what he wants ... But it's too late to stop now."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_119,"Nothing I could've said would've made a difference. My words didn't reach Lili Borea. If anything, I just made things worse ... It seems we can't avoid fighting. It must be done."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_120,"We defeated Lili Borea. However, instead of feeling good about it, I feel empty, unfulfilled ... It's an uncertain feeling I can't put into words. Was there a correct way to answer her questions? Am I even making any progress like this? I feel like I understand less with every step I take ..."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_121,"Ever since Lili Borea told me that alchemists only think of themselves, those words have been haunting my thoughts. I'm not sure if my mother was actually a good person, nor do I know the answer to how I will face alchemy yet ... For now, we should report back to the survey base."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_122,"We returned to the survey base and reported our findings about Lili Borea and Corleonis. The chief is right—the only way we'll discover the truth is by moving forward. Now that Lili Borea has been defeated, we should be able to head to the tower and investigate there."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_123,"We found yet another large tower atop the tower. There seems to be a path on the opposite shore, but I'm not sure how we're supposed to cross over to there. There are a few places we can search around here, so let's see if we can find some hints about how we might get across."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_124,
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_125,
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_126,
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_127,"After investigating, we learned that what's up ahead is not a tower, but a drawbridge. It appears to be non-functional since the power is out, but there must something we can do about that. For now, just lowering it should be enough, so I'll see what I can create with alchemy to make that happen."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_128,"After inserting my self-made Energy Cell into the control center, the ""tower"" fell and formed a bridge connecting both sides of the river. It was quite dangerous. I thought I was going to be caught in the explosion ... Without a doubt, alchemy can be pretty dangerous when used incorrectly. But the path to the next region has opened, so it's time to go on!"
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_129,"We've fulfilled quite a few requests for the Welleks. I'm not sure if this will suffice, but we've reached a nice stopping point, so it might be good to return to the survey base for now. Let's hurry up and go."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_130,""" ... Please. Give me back my body.""<CR>Lili Borea's words still ring in my ears ... But I can't let that stop me from continuing the investigation. For the time being, we should go check out that conspicuous metal tree."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_131,"We made it to the metal tree, and it sure is huge. While wondering whether it came to be that way due to the disaster, we met a group of talking bird-like monsters called the Geni. They seem much friendlier than the Neru. We might learn something about the area if we talk to them, so let's go do that."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_132,"We met Keke, the leader of the Geni. To our surprise, we learned that they call Corleonis their ""master."" I don't really see the resemblance looks-wise, so what sort of connection do they have? I can't make sense of them at all. We need to gather some more information first."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_133,"Our information gathering taught us that the Geni were created by Corleonis, and they collect particles to give as ""tribute."" This relationship may be the key to learning more about Corleonis. Let's head to Ramus Radix Station, the place where they bring their tributes."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_134,"At the station we found an altar, and another Geni too. According to him, Corleonis is collecting particles for ""the greater good."" What that means exactly is still unclear, though. It seems we've hit a dead end ... We don't have any other leads, so let's head to the Mana Transposing Furnace."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_135,"We made it to the Mana Transposing Furnace. There's a building with a door that won't open, and all functions have been halted as the power source has worn out over the years. It'll probably take some effort to get things back up and running. After checking things out, I'll try to fix the power."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_136,"After looking inside the transposing furnace, it's clear that the core is broken. It seems like I'll need some special ingredients to fix it. Hopefully there's something around here that will point us in the right direction."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_137,"Turns out that the core is made out of a material called Stirium, which can be found in an underground cave to the west. We have no idea if there's any left, but we'll just have to head to the cave to find out."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_138,"We were finally able to find a piece of Stirium while exploring the underground cave. I think it may have been the only piece left ... Maybe it all got mined? Anyways, I think I can make the part I need to fix the core with this, so once that's ready we should head back to the Mana Transposing Furnace."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_139,"The repairs went well, and we could go through the door. Inside was some kind of laboratory or something. There might be an important clue hiding somewhere. We should take a look around."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_140,"Corleonis showed up and went on about ""fate"" and ""truth"" and a bunch of other stuff I couldn't make sense of ... More important than that, Nina is a homunculus?! So much happened at once, my head is still spinning. I think I should talk to Nina first."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_141,We learned that Nina is a homunculus created by an alchemist named Marina Friede. We should hear the rest of the story.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_142,"Nina is a homunculus. It's so unbelievable, I can hardly internalize it. The chief said that he would leave the decision regarding her up to us ... In other words, we need to decide how to respond to this. I should go talk to everyone else or try to gather relevant information."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_143,"According to what Nina said, this area used to be a shopping district. If that's true, there must have been a lot of people here back then, so maybe we can find something that was left behind. Let's look around to see if we can find anything useful for our investigation."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_144,"The signs of the city's alchemy-driven development linger like a scent in the air. As true as it is that alchemy destroyed this country, it also enriched the people's lives. There are two sides to the truth. It might be best to properly look at both of them ..."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_145,"I talked to Viktor and Isla about Nina, and Viktor's words really struck a chord with me. The time we've spent together won't disappear. No matter her true identity, it doesn't change the fact that she rescued us either. We should put our faith in what we felt then."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_146,"Apparently something is bothering Rutger about Nina, so he's going off to look into it. I wish he would stop deciding on things by himself, but I might be able to learn from that go-getter attitude of his. I should go along with him to see what it is."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_147,We came across a giant monster on the way to the Great Tree. Maybe it moved in now Vesper is gone. Let's keep our guard up when fighting it.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_148,Situated under the tree's shade is a grave that seems to have been made by Nina. Rutger said he got what he came for ... I also think that the feelings present there were bigger than words could express.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_149,"Lenja wants to give Nina a necklace. That straightforward way of expressing her feelings is just like Lenja. This kind of thing is my specialty, so I'd like to lend a hand. I'll ask Lenja about what she has in mind, then get to work."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_150,I gave the necklace to Lenja. I'll leave it to her to present it to Nina.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_151,"After listening to what everyone had to say, I talked to Nina once again. She seemed pretty apologetic, but it's normal to take matters regarding a friend seriously, and I don't think of it as causing us trouble. Her past being what it is, I understand why it would be hard to talk about. I want to talk to Nina and hear as much of her true feelings as possible."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_152,"""I just want things to stay as they are."" Not, ""I want you to forgive me,"" nor, ""I want you to accept me."" I feel like Nina finally bared her true feelings to me. I want to talk to the others about what she said ... I think everything will be all right."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_153,"Nina will stay with us. That's the decision we came to as a team. I'm glad we settled it ... And Nina is an essential person to have on board. She's a living witness to the age of Aladiss, after all. On that note, we decided to start working on the clues she had for us relating to Doctor Marina. Let's head to the laboratory ruins!"
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_154,"We've arrived at the hideaway where Doctor Marina and Nina spent their days together. We haven't learned anything yet, but I'm sure we'll find a clue with everyone's help."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_155,"After thorough searching, we found a broken device. I have a feeling something might happen if I can fix it. Time to gather the necessary ingredients and make what I need in order to fix it."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_156,"Fixing the device let us go underground, but all the documents are submerged in water. There are some material boxes that seem okay though, so we should take them back up with us."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_157,"The boxes we brought up with us contained a Memory Vial that was very securely stored. It contained information left behind by the brilliant alchemist Doctor Marina—extremely important clues not just for us, but also for Nina personally. But right then, Corleonis suddenly barged in and stole the Memory Vial. We have to hurry and get it back!"
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_158,"Corleonis specifically pointing us towards the Metal Tree may very well be a trap like Lenja said, but it's not like we can just ignore him. We need to keep pressing forward to find the truth. We should figure out how to make our way to the Metal Tree."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_159,"We were able obtain geographical information about the area inside the station. According to it, the area around Pergrica Turm was originally underground and the treelike part is an elevator shaft! If we can find a way inside, we should be able to go up to the top."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_160,"We made it to the entrance of the underground passage marked on the map. There's a lot of rubble in the way, and removing it seems difficult ... If we had something like a ladder, we could maybe get over it. I wonder if there's a spot where we could place a ladder nearby."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_161,"We finally found the Great Elevator. It looks like it still has power, so it should work. But it could be a trap, so we should advance with caution."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_162,
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_163,"I opened my eyes and found myself in the bed of my atelier. That mysterious man blew me away and I fell ... but I seem to be fine. I do feel kind of sluggish, I guess. I must have been saved somehow, but something feels off ... While I make sure I'm really okay, I should go report to the chief."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_164,"In the middle of my report, Lenja said she noticed something. Apparently my mana feels different than before. She couldn't narrow it down more than that, so we decided I should consult with Cledia about it. What is going on with my body?"
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_165,"I ... lost my memories of my mother? Even hearing that, I don't understand. I can't get them back? What do I do now? Just keep working on the investigation? No ... wait ... Why did I join the Research Team in the first place again?"
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_166,
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_167,"I can't remember my mother's face. I can't remember her last words to me on the day of the mana disaster either. But my friends are here, and I have the days we've spent together. Not everything is lost. There are things that are important to me here ... It's time to settle this."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_168,"I've been constantly chasing after the alchemy my mother used. Now that I've lost my memory, I realize that I was held captive by it. I wonder how my mother felt, keeping her alchemy secret all that time. As I am now, I may never understand ... But I still need to move forward and believe in my chosen path."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_169,"In order to defeat Corleonis, we first need to destroy that ice wall. To do that, we have to go gather some Stirium ... Or so I thought, but apparently Rutger had smuggled away a piece for himself. After I finish making it into a bullet, we can go settle this."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_170,"We made it to the front of the elevator, but it was broken during the last fight. I have to make sure that I fix it properly, so we don't get shaken off this time."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_171,We made it to the top safely this time ... Our rematch with Corleonis lies ahead. We better make sure that we aren't forgetting any unfinished business before going in.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_172,"Another encounter with Corleonis. Although the ice did me in last time, I have my special bullet ready to ensure that it doesn't happen again. There's no way we'll lose now."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_173,"Although he was here the last time we fought, Basilius is nowhere to be seen. I guess that means we'll have to force him out. Time to defeat Corleonis and move forward."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_174,"We finally defeated Corleonis! Not only that, we also learned what his goal was. A grand plan had been put in motion here, unnoticed by us all. But when we reached the top, that man was nowhere to be found. I want to go after him, but we need to focus on our original purpose and recover Doctor Marina's Memory Vial."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_175,"We were able to recover Doctor Marina's Memory Vial. Listening to the recording, I figured out that the atelier that I had made my base was originally hers! Maybe we can finally see what's behind that door. We should hurry to the atelier."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_176,"Behind the door that we hadn't been able to open was a large amount of important research materials left behind by Doctor Marina, the most notable of which being a recording from Marina herself. I wonder how Nina feels being able to hear her mother's voice like this again ... Maybe we should give her some space to think."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_177,Nina seems to have collected herself. That means we can start our investigation again. The capital isn't far off. Let's uncover all the secrets behind Aladiss.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_178,"I decided how I should interact with the Welleks. As Erhard stressed, I have to follow the ""rules."" For the time being, let's talk about things with the people in the settlement together with Nina, who will be joining us from here on out."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_179,"In order to keep making progress on our investigation, we need the cooperation of the Welleks. Let's see if there's anything we can help with inside the settlement."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_180,"According to the report from the other Research Team members, Lili Borea has a stronghold atop the cliffs to the south. There's a giant, old elevator in the Neru's territory that seems necessary to get there. We should ask Laurie for permission to use it."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_181,"We decided to take a breather back at the base after running out of clues. Like the chief said, it might be good to talk with everyone."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_182,"Thinking back on it, I've been so focused on the investigation that I haven't really taken time to talk with the others much. I'd been thinking about a lot myself, so it was a good opportunity. Let's switch back to our investigation. Like Lenja proposed, we should head to the Mana Transposing Furnace."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_183,We were given a Memory Vial at the Neru settlement. Let's return to the survey base and check what's inside.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_184,"For now, we can either head to the observatory and use the key we got, or make our way to the Great Elevator in the south and track down Lili Borea."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_185,"It was great to make it to the capital city of Calumna, but what we found was ... just a wheat field. I thought it was just destroyed to the point that no trace remained, but Nina is right, it's strange that this is the only place that doesn't have anything left. Let's take a look around and get a grasp of the situation."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_186,"We looked through a fissure in the invisible wall and discovered a pristine white metropolis on the other side. I don't know what kind of technology this is, but we've finally reached the enemy's stronghold, and so we'll need to be more vigilant than ever in our investigation."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_187,"We need to pioneer the Lacuna region, the enemy's headquarters. It's important to be careful, but there are also a lot of things that need to be investigated as well. Let's take things one at a time, starting with what seems the most achievable."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_188,"According to Nina, the most important locations in the capital are Lacuna Castle and the 1st Imperial Laboratory. However, the castle is nowhere to be seen, so I guess we'll go to the lab first. I sure am glad we have Nina around ..."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_189,"We've made it to the lab, but can't seem to get inside. In order to open the entrance doors, we need to use the three control towers to turn on the power. Let's get to it!"
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_190,"We've reached the control tower in the imperial graveyard, and everything seems to be in order. Let's operate the circulator as usual."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_191,"Operating the circulator went fine, but nothing changed ... I guess there's another location controlling the mana, so we should let Lenja lead the way."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_192,"We tried to follow along the pathway and were suddenly surrounded by monsters. It's like they were waiting for us ... We need to press forward, so let's get rid of them quickly."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_193,"Vesper. The greatest obstacle standing between us and Basilius. He said he was ready for us, so we'd better be ready too. Vesper's ""sleeping brethren"" lie here in this land. Before we fight ... I want to learn more about the people resting here. I think it's something I should know."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_196,I think we've gone around the cemetery enough now. Let's get back to the investigation and follow the flow of mana.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_197,"The road led to a peculiar facility. I wonder if it's also related to the graves ... It looks like the path leads inside, so let's check it out."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_198,"Inside the facility was a grave with Basilius's name on it. A grave ... So he's dead ...? Then who did we see? While grappling with this, Rutger noticed the grave's hidden secret. The flow of mana seems to continue through the hidden pathway."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_199,Monsters were waiting at the end of the stairs. Seems like they must be gatekeepers of sorts. Let's be careful while fighting them.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_200,"They had been guarding the gate for a long time, so it makes sense they were quite powerful foes. Luckily, we managed to beat them without any major incidents. Now all that's left is to use the circulator to control the mana supply. Let's try it right away."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_201,"We safely completed our search of the imperial graveyard. But the question remains regarding just who that man we met before was. Isla thinks he must've been a fake, which is certainly possible. Whatever the case, something feels off."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_202,"We arrived at the tower in the commercial district, however it's an ""extreme manabound area,"" and we can't get to the entrance. We need to look around and see if we can find a way to solve this issue."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_203,"Nina said she recognizes the scenery around here. Apparently there's a house nearby that she and Doctor Marina spent a brief amount of time in before fleeing the country. There may be something worth checking there, so let's hurry on over."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_204,"Nina told us the exterior looks wrong. She has a point—all the buildings around here are a little odd. Did Basilius cut corners restoring them? They seem incomplete ... In order to learn more, we should go to the nearby theater. As we left her former home, I couldn't help but notice Nina looked a little lonely."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_205,We made it to the entrance of the theater. Let's head further inside.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_206,"As we stepped forward, a rumbling sound came from the building. That's not the sound of any average monster. We should be on our guard as we advance further."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_207,The rumbling has gotten much closer. There's an elevator right in front of us ... Something lies ahead.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_208,"I can't believe Lili Borea was here. What a surprise. But I've been thinking about what to say to her for a long time. I can't turn away now. Not from her, nor from this land's past. It's time to fight. I have to take on her rage, hatred ... everything."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_209,"Her last words are etched onto my heart like a curse. As a modern alchemist, I can't allow myself to forget those words. As if it were a parting gift, we found the Energy Core she used. I'm not sure how it works, but it's very impressive. Something like this might even be able to work on the extreme manabound area ... Let's go back to that tower."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_210,"We used up Lili Borea's Energy Core, but thanks to it we were able to take control of the control tower. This isn't the end though, we need to keep going."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_211,"We made it to the administrative district control tower, but the mana around the door is warped and piling up. Is it still mid-restoration? After considering our options, I decided to try using a method similar to synthesis to see if I could extract information from the mana. I'll do what I can."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_212,"Flammi found a big clue for us. It looks like we can get in the council building through a secret passage, so let's try it out."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_213,"We made it to the council building, but we can't find the secret passage. I guess all we can do is look around the inside."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_218,"We've looked around at several potential areas, but no clues yet. It's a dead end, but if I can reconstruct the flow of mana like I did earlier, I might be able to gather some information. First, we need to look for some disarrayed mana."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_221,"We uncovered some information about criminals from the past. If I remember correctly, they mentioned a judicial office. That should be to the southwest ... Let's go check it out next."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_222,"We made it to the judicial office, but where would we find information on the secret passage? I guess we should look inside first."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_223,"After looking inside, we saw some disarrayed mana. Let's hurry and do some synthesizing to gather information."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_224,"""Only the sage shows the way."" What does that mean, exactly? I guess we need to focus on figuring out who or what the ""sage"" is first."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_225,"So the ""sage"" in this case was a stone statue with a staff. After forcing the wall open, we found a hidden passageway. It took some effort to get to this point, but if we use the passageway, we should be able to get to the control tower. Let's continue on."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_226,"We went through a lot, but we finally made it to the control tower. Let's hurry and get control access."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_227,We completed our investigation of the control tower in the administrative district. It seems that alchemists other than Doctor Marina had also rebelled. I wonder if that has any connection to the destruction of Aladiss. Let's keep making steady progress.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_228,We've obtained control access to all three towers. That means we're all ready ... but maybe we should go back to base first. It would be good to report in and get some rest.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_229,"What happens next after our investigation ends ... We each have our own futures in mind. Even if those futures go down different paths, the time we've spent together will never disappear. It's finally time for us to confront the heart of the matter. Let's give it our all, and come back with a good report."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_230,We were able to open the laboratory gate. Vesper might be waiting for us up ahead. It feels unlikely that we won't face some sort of obstacle. Let's investigate inside carefully.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_231,"Apparently we need authorization to activate the device in order to go up. I think everything we need should be in here, so let's look for clues."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_232,"As soon as we entered the laboratory room, we were attacked by a powerful-looking monster. We can't run away if we want to look inside."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_233,"We defeated the monster and acquired the control authorization. As for detailed information, all we could really figure out is that this room was used for monster research. Perhaps this is where the mutants were born too ..."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_234,This room's control authorization should be in the device in front of us. Let's check it out.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_235,"We successfully acquired the control authorization. It seems that the inside of this castle isn't completely restored either. Just the vital functions ... This may be proof that things aren't so simple for the other side either. I know we shouldn't get our hopes up, but that sounds like good news to me."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_236,We found some disarrayed mana inside the room. The place seems very unstable. This means we might be able to retrieve some memories if I can repair it like last time.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_237,"The memory extraction was a success! We were able to retrieve a conversation between Basilius and his underling. He had the absolutely reckless idea to record all knowledge and technology that existed. But with the means they had back then, that may have very well been an attainable goal."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_238,We have all the control authorizations we need. Let's go back to the central altar.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_239,"Vesper seemed to know that we'd come here ... It's time to settle this. We have to throw all our combined might at him. We can win. Let's take down Vesper, and then take the fight to Basilius!"
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_241,"We defeated Vesper. This is a big victory, especially for Viktor and Isla, but we aren't finished yet. By using the mana circulator we cleared the barrier blocking us from seeing Lacuna Castle, home of Emperor Basilius. Let's go in and take him down."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_242,The architecture of Lacuna Castle is of an intricacy far beyond anything made nowadays. But it's not only beautiful. It feels ... strange. Maybe something will jump out at us. We need to be more careful than ever before as we move forward.
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_243,"Mana is flowing inside the castle. It almost feels like being inside a living creature's stomach. There don't seem to be any lurking threats at the moment, but in this place, it feels like anything could happen at any time. Like Lenja said, it may be scary, but we're not going to run. Let's keep going."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_244,"We found a room that has something to do with Memory Vials ... Probably the production of them. The records we found talked about a plan to collect the memories of every citizen of the Aladissian Empire. Could this ""Almighty Memory Vial"" have been the cause of their destruction? It seems to me that this is proof that Aladiss had gone insane. Just what is this ""atonement""?"
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_245,"Basilius's ""body"" was left in this room. How long has he lived by taking his memories and supplanting them into a new body ...? I don't know if he can truly be considered the same person. What's for certain is that he's a phantom left behind by the empire, and only we can stop him."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_246,"Hundreds of years ago, the Aladissian Empire fell to ruin and alchemy became taboo. That curse has continued to bind us even to this day. Not only that, it has hidden away the history of alchemy, and the truth. But it's time to set things straight. As an alchemist of the modern age, I vow to put an end to his schemes."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_261,"I was taught how to make a bottle to store Alstahlia nectar. It should be useful while exploring, so I should try making one right away."
STR_QUEST_MAIN_FLAVOR_262,"In the end, we didn't find out much about Corleonis ... Whatever comes next, I think it would be best to take a break back at the survey base first."

STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_000,"I can't say whether Isla or Viktor has more of a point, but Viktor's clothes can't stay ripped. I'll use alchemy to get Isla the materials she needs to fix them up right away."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_001,"Isla let me watch her work, which she really seemed to enjoy. Isla loves making clothes way more than I thought if she even wants to make them in a place like this. I've also been wondering about her past, so I'll try asking about that when I get the chance."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_002,"Isla told me about one of her old friends. She said she was a little like me, but I wonder what she was like. There's still a lot I'm curious about, but I've got to scrounge up materials to patch up Rutger's clothing first."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_003,"I gave the materials to Isla and Rutger. They're still arguing as usual, but I can't tell if that means they're actually on good terms or not. Either way, that's another request down."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_004,"According to Viktor, Isla's been feeling run down. Well, our fights have been pretty rough lately, so she could definitely use a break. I'll craft some new furniture for the base so she can relax without a second thought."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_005,"I had a chat with Isla after getting the new furniture ready. I get that she's worried about me, but I have things I want to accomplish, so I can't just back down. I'll just have to get even stronger so she won't have to worry anymore."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_006,"I really did take things too far, so I'm glad I got to apologize. Isla needs some time to deal with her own thoughts, but she's said she'll work on making my new outfit while she does, so I'm excited. I'd better hurry up and get the materials she asked for."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_007,"I brought Isla the materials she needed for her tailoring. We might not be able to make the same sort of clothing as she used to with her friend, but there must be something unique that we can make together. I don't really know how it's going to turn out, but it'll be an outfit made by a friend, so I'm sure it will be great!"
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_008,"Erhard went right back to everyone after blowing up at us. If it wasn't for the chief, we might not have ever met. Doesn't that make him pretty amazing? ... He's kind of terrifying when he's angry though, so maybe we should cut back on the teasing."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_009,"I spent some time chatting with Isla about the Alber. The hats they wear are so big, so I guess I can get why they value them the same as their lives. I'll have to get them some good dye ingredients."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_010,"I thought Isla was stubborn, but it's a little different than just that. It's more like she can't ignore people who need help or are troubled. If it were mere stubbornness, she wouldn't be able to smile like that. All her talk of gathering favors is probably how she hides her bashfulness."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_011,"Isla said that she wants to make a building that could be used as an inn. I don't know what she was discussing with Cledia, but I'm sure she's got her reasons. Well, let's pick out a good building and then get to work."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_012,"According to Isla, it's going to be an inn meant for guests of different species. She's thinking so far into the future—way past when the surveying and pioneering will be done—which is really impressive. I'll also help out as much as I can."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_013,"Isla has been close to me this whole time. That may have been out of self-interest at first, but that's certainly not the case now. Looking back, it's clear that Isla is the reason I was able to make it this far. We might all go our own separate ways soon, but the bond we've woven will remain. It's my greatest treasure."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_020,"I thought I'd ask Nina about her time as a mercenary, and we ended up deciding to fight monsters together. It should be a good chance to see her fighting style close up. I'll have to be careful not to drag her down."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_021,"Nina told me a lot about her mercenary work, but I still feel like I don't know much about her as a person. I don't even know where she was born. Maybe she'll tell me more about herself after we've become better acquainted."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_022,"I didn't expect Nina to like cute things so much. Well, as long as she doesn't get too distracted decorating her gun. Anyways, I should make the bullets she wants. Our guns are shaped differently, so I'll have to think this through."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_023,"There's something about Nina that feels unlike anyone else I've ever met. It sounds like she's been friends with alchemists besides me before, too. I wonder just what kind of experiences she's had up until now. She's full of mystery ... I hope she'll tell me more about her past someday."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_024,I'd been wanting to have a good talk with Nina. I'm glad she invited me. I should prepare a spot for us to talk over a nice cup of tea.
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_025,"I wonder how Nina will feel after she gets her feelings sorted out. I can only try to imagine right now, but I think she'll probably be lonely. When that happens, I hope I can be someone she can count on ..."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_026,"Nina would be the best person to fix Doctor Marina's room. I could do it, but only Nina knows what it was actually like back then. I'll get her the Repair Kits she needs."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_027,"Nina seems to have sorted out her feelings. The loneliness she feels isn't due to sadness, but of having known and felt love. The time she spent with Doctor Marina and the love she felt then was so incredibly precious. I hope the time I spend with Nina becomes something she will think back on with the same fondness."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_028,"When I really think about it, I see Nina's point. Guns have a lot of advantages over close-range weapons. I guess money's the main problem, though. A gun needs bullets, and bullets are expensive. This makes me think Nina must have been quite the talented mercenary."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_029,"She wandered off holding Lenja in her arms. She's not ... going to use Lenja as a body pillow, is she? Sure, she's cute and fluffy, but ... Well, just in case, I should go check up on them."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_030,"Nina wants Repair Kits to do some maintenance on her gun. But she wants so many. What kind of maintenance is she doing? Well, I'm sure she won't use them for anything weird, so I'll get them to her as soon as I can."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_031,"It's times like these that make me realize Nina really was a mercenary. She sure is hard to read. Though, I do understand wanting to be prepared for life-or-death situations. I should make sure I keep my gun in good condition as well."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_032,"A massive stuffed animal being there to greet you when you get home ...? Sounds like that'd be terrifying at night, though I guess not if you're used to it. Anyways, I want to make a stuffed animal and place it for Nina. Didn't I see a big one somewhere?"
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_033,"Stuffed animals really are important to Nina, huh? I hope she likes the one I've placed for her. If the Aladissian Empire was still around, maybe I would have been able to see Nina running her own stuffed animal shop."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_034,"Even though it was destroyed, Nina's hometown still remains. Even if one day people come in from other places and the traces of how it once was completely disappear, this land will still be Nina's hometown. I hope we can continue to pioneer this place so that no matter how it may change, it will be a wonderful and new Aladiss, loved by all."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_035,"Nina isn't the Nina that Doctor Marina sought, but she was still someone very dear to her. Nina is a very dear friend to us as well. I hope we can give her strength to live out her future."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_040,"I'd thought that Viktor was the sort to be just as hard on others as he is on himself, but he's surprisingly nice to those around him. I'm really glad that he's seeing me for who I actually am, so I'll work hard to not break that trust."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_041,"A Research Team member still hasn't come back from their survey ...? That doesn't sound good. We can run over to him in a flash since we know where he has gone. Well, after we've done what we need to do to get ready."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_042,"Viktor values righteousness more than others, which leads to him taking extreme stances sometimes. It seems to be related to his history with Erhard, but maybe things will start to make sense the more we investigate together."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_043,"... So, Viktor can get like this too. In the end, there's not always an absolutely correct answer for everything. And it's not like I don't get how Lili Borea felt, so I don't think there's anything else to do but keep mulling it over."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_044,"I'm glad that Viktor could figure out his own answer. I think he's still bothered by it, but he looks more at ease than when he was completely fixated on what was right. It would be nice to see him learn to make quick decisions in similar situations."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_045,"Viktor and Isla couldn't be any more different, but you can definitely tell they're siblings when you hear them talk. Honestly, I'm a little jealous that they get along so well. If I had a big brother, would we be like that?"
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_046,"I thought he was an all-around capable person, but Viktor's surprisingly clumsy as it turns out. Rebuilding a big weapon like that from scratch isn't going to be easy, but this sort of situation is where alchemy shines."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_047,"Taking on fiddly work when he knows he's not good at it is so very much like Viktor. As much as I want to applaud him for challenging himself, I wish he'd ask for help a bit more often, since we're adventuring together and all."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_048,"I don't really see it, but looking at things from Lenja's perspective, Viktor probably seems pretty imposing. But it's not like there's anyone else who can step in, so I guess she's just going to have to get used to it ..."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_049,"He sure must love naps for him to have even slept during classes. Well, given how on guard Viktor is all the time, he could probably use a break. Maybe he'd like it if I made a space that he could snooze in?"
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_050,"Team member injuries, huh? There are plenty of things needed to treat those, but we'd better start by preparing lots of bandages. Extra effective ones would be even better too, so let's hurry and get to work!"
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_051,"It's thanks to Erhard that I'm able to investigate with Isla and Viktor, so I should show him my appreciation too. Since I'm the only one here who can use alchemy, I'll use it to solve all kinds of problems for everyone's sake!"
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_052,"Viktor's a trustworthy friend of mine, so of course I don't want to see him get hurt. I need to become an even better alchemist. One who can support her team and not have to be protected all the time."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_060,"A Neru went missing after being attacked by monsters. Lenja really wants to look into it, so I'll help too. We should start by looking for clues in the area where the monster attack happened."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_061,"We beat up the monsters and helped find the missing Neru. We were only able to help them thanks to Lenja taking the request, so why does she seem so down on herself? I should try to learn more about her."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_062,"I think Lenja's really strong. If she truly is that much weaker than other Welleks, then they must be incredible. Now that we've fought some monsters, hopefully she can have a bit more confidence in her abilities."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_063,I think Lenja focuses so much on her failures because she has a strong sense of responsibility. But I'm sure this incident made her realize that there's nothing wrong with having someone help you or relying on your friends. I hope this will help her think more positively.
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_064,"I'm glad Lenja's feeling a bit more confident. I don't know much about her past, but she looks a lot more relaxed now. Hopefully my advice helped encourage her a bit."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_065,"Lenja says she wants to go the temple, so I'm going to accompany her. She said that she's going to pray to the Harvest Deity, but I wonder what the Harvest Deity is like. Maybe I'll take this opportunity to ask her about stuff afterwards."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_066,"The Harvest Deity seems like she's really important to the Welleks. Both the Silva here in Aladiss and the Flumme in Eustella worship her. The ways and customs of the faith seem to have changed over the years, but I think that belief in the Harvest Deity will continue on into the future."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_067,"I wonder what kind of person Lenja's father was. I don't really remember my father, so it's hard to relate. I wonder if he was really strict. I should ask Lenja more about her father when I get a chance."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_068,"I'm so impressed that Lenja says she'd be fine traveling on her own. I can't imagine how I'd ever get along during surveys if I didn't have Isla and Viktor by my side. I just hope Lenja can overcome her anxiety, but it feels like it might take her some time."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_069,"The other team members are looking worn out. From what they told us, they're exhausted from repeatedly fighting strong monsters. I should do what I can to help them out."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_070,I gave the team members some Smoke Bombs so that they can avoid having to fight monsters all the time. Hopefully this will make things a bit easier for them.
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_071,"I guess I won't see everyone as often once our travels come to an end. It's kind of sad. But, we'll have a lot more free time after this whole thing is over, and I'd like to spend that time together with everyone. With that in mind, it's time to get to work."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_072,"I don't really understand Lenja's journey of atonement, but if her goal was to help people, then it might as well already be over. She's going to have helped more people than any other Welleks by far. If I don't say something, I'm worried she'll be atoning forever ..."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_080,"Rutger says he wants proof that we're worth his trust. It would be nice if we could all trust each other after Erhard went to the trouble of teaming us up. It sounds like he'd prefer to work alone, but there has to be some way to convince him otherwise."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_081,"I don't think what Rutger was doing was right, but it's hard to judge him, all things considered. I should try to get to know him better since we're going to keep traveling together."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_082,"Rutger told me about his past again. Now I can see why he said he's no match for Erhard. He went into a lot more detail this time, too. Does this mean he finally trusts me a bit?"
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_083,"Putting an end to all of those who deal in people's memories, so that one day alchemy can be accepted ... It was quite a shock to hear Rutger of all people say something like that. He claims it would just be an obvious consequence, but I'm going to mark that excuse down as him being embarrassed. He tries to hide it, but deep down, he's a kind person."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_084,"Rutger asked me to make him a container. He says it's for some relics he's collected, but when did he find time to collect so many? Either way, no point in keeping him waiting."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_085,"Rutger left a ton of relics in the container I made. How did he manage to hide so many? If it was me, I'd just ask Erhard to hold onto them, but Rutger seems to have issues trusting people."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_086,"I thought Rutger had a really serious look on his face, but it turns out he's just hungry. He doesn't really seem like the type to overeat ... Either way, I haven't seen him like this before. I should get him the ingredients he wants."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_087,I gave Rutger the ingredients he asked for. I guess growing up in an environment where food is scarce would make anyone get stressed out as soon as they get hungry. I'll have to keep this in mind and make sure we carry enough food with us.
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_088,"I always thought Rutger cared only about things he could sell, but he seems to collect things that suit his taste as well. I should ask him to show me what he's collected in ruins so far ... Though I doubt he'll just readily agree to it."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_089,"I always wondered why Lenja spends so much time around Rutger. It makes a lot more sense now. He looks pretty intense, but Rutger's a surprisingly caring person. Maybe I could learn a thing or two from him."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_090,"With a foster parent like Erhard, I can see where Rutger gets his clever sense of humor. It's nice that he finally accepts me as a friend, but I want to do my part and protect him, too."
STR_QUEST_CHARA_FLAVOR_091,"Seeing Rutger, who's lost his memories countless times, look so sad made me feel a little depressed myself, even though I don't actually feel like I lost my memories. I need to get stronger so that I never lose any more memories."

STR_OPTION_DEFINE_208,Atelier Yumia
STR_OPTION_DEFINE_209,Sample
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_000,"Yumia, you're under observation for the time being. Don't go too far from Viktor and Isla."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_001,"With the clearing of that high-density mana, the scope of our survey has greatly expanded."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_002,Leaving it to you was the right call. Keep up the good work!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_003,"Finding valuable leads is the top priority. With that in mind, safety is equally important."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_004,You just got rid of the manabound area. There's no need to overexert yourself.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_005,That Rutger is going to be the death of me. What am I going to do with him ...
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_006,"It's true Rutger has a foul mouth, but I can vouch for his skill. Try and get along with him."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_007,"A talking monster named Vesper, huh ... He's sure to be a threat to us in the future."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_008,The mediator should be here soon. Please wait a little longer.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_009,"Well, that's just how it is. Your—you know ... That's a taboo word here."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_010,Our investigation and pioneering effort in the Sivash region start in earnest now.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_011,Keep in mind that maintaining good relations with the locals going forward is important as well.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_012,Let's keep it between the two of us that I told you he's like a son to me.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_013,"He'd definitely be angry if he heard I said that, haha."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_014,I'll be looking for Lenja on my end too. You all just do what you can.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_015,It seems like you've all become a big happy family.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_016,"However, the further you go into the continent, the more dangerous it will become."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_017,"But with as good of a group as you have now, I can send you off without any worries."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_018,Basilius ... Could he really still be around?
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_019,"Well, maybe I shouldn't be surprised by any of the strange things that happen in this place ..."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_020,You've been doing a lot lately. At least get some rest at times like this.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_021,You seem rested up. I'll leave the investigation back in your hands.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_022,I'll leave the matter concerning Nina to you all.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_023,"She's been fighting by your side all this time, so I believe you'll make the right decision."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_024,"Thank you for choosing the ideal option. You've become good friends, haven't you."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_025,"If you have time to talk with me, you have time to get yourself over to Cledia."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_026,I'm just glad you're still with us ... That's for certain.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_027,But you lost your memories of your mother ... I ... I don't know what to say ...
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_028,"I can feel your will and determination. I'll be counting on you yet again, Yumia."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_029,"At the very end, we found quite the unexpected place all hidden away ..."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_030,But our investigation is nearing its finale. We should stay vigilant until the very end.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_031,"There's still a lot of work left for the Research Team, but I think we can take a breather at this point."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_032,"I think I might go back to Eustella too. It's been a while, and taking a break sounds nice."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_033,Show me firsthand how you are able to dispel the forbidden lands.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_034,Only then will I decide whether or not to allow your investigation to take place here.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_035,"You've received orders from your chief, right?"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_036,"If I were to lose my position as leader, it would certainly make your investigation more difficult."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_037,"To prevent that from happening, I expect you to exercise extreme caution inside the settlement."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_038,"In order to walk the correct path, one must learn what the truth is."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_039,It is my wish that you take this as guidance to put you on the right path.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_040,"I've been observing the people of the Research Team, but you lot are definitely the most interesting group."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_041,We'll help look for Lenja too. You all be careful.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_042,I'm glad to know that Lenja is safe.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_043,Ahead lies uncharted territory for us as well. Be careful.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_044,Recovering a memory that has returned to the earth as mana is impossible.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_045,I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_046,"So, you've chosen not to dwell on your lost memories and move forward."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_047,I'm sure that this will be the right path for you.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_048,"With the forbidden lands cleared from the continent, we of the Silva clan can expand the range of our activities."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_049,Perhaps we should take this opportunity to properly traverse and see this land we call home.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_050,"Sorry, sorry. I do not know. About Lili Borea."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_051,"Thank you, thank you. Nectar is now. Easy to get."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_052,"Unnecessary, unnecessary. Nectar is now. Unnecessary."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_053,"It's strange, it's strange. What will happen now?"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_054,"Master Corleonis, our master. Protect us, his gifts do."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_055,"Life without our master, we will accept. The time for that has come, I think ..."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_056,Know your place and don't act out of line. You're a disgrace to Eustella.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_057,"I know this is too little too late, but ... Yumia, you are central to the entire Research Team's success."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_058,Please guide us. Help us find the truth behind this continent's ruin.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_059,I'm busy right now ... Let's talk later.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_060,"If the chief accepts you, so will I. Do your best not to let us down."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_061,We can never have enough medicine. I'd be grateful for any help.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_062,Don't try to slip me that strange stuff!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_063,"It's not that bad an injury, really. Don't make a big deal out of it."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_064,"That really fixed it? It won't suddenly hurt again, right?"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_065,"Ugh, it hurts ... Isn't there anything that can at least dull the pain?"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_066,Is my body really okay now?
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_067,"... Just don't cause any problems, okay?"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_068,So exciting! Can you fix it soon?
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_069,Wowie! It's brand-new!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_070,"You're going to fix it, Tall One?"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_071,Thanks a bunch!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_072,"When it's all nice, let me know, okay?"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_073,"Are you all right, Tall Ones?"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_074,Are the weapons ready?
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_075,"We've used the same weapons since long ago, so they're very worn down."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_076,"A trade, a trade. Nectar for information."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_077,"Now then, let's see your report."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_078,Hmm ... It seems the pioneering efforts still have a ways to go. Keep up the good work.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_079,It looks like there's been some progress towards our pioneering goals. Nice work.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_080,Please get rid of those monsters.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_081,I'm excited to receive that special glove.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_082,"Sorry to leave this to you, but thank you for your help."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_083,It would be nice if we could find out something major.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_100,Sorry to saddle you with this bothersome stuff. Take care on your way.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_101,"Ah, it's you! So the delivery went well?"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_102,"Too much work, not enough hands. I'm about up to my ears!"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_103,I'm saved! I need to hurry and get the base in order now.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_104,"That bandana, you part of the Research Team? Something smells good ..."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_105,Finally some food! Thanks a ton!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_106,I should be less busy soon ... Sorry for it always being like this.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_107,How's the delivery going?
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_108,All the other work is finally done. Things at this base should stabilize soon too.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_109,I'll clean up quick. Food comes after that.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_110,"After some food, it's back to work I guess."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_111,Humans are unknown creatures from the Neru's point of view. We have to let them know we want to be friends!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_112,"Back in Eustella, I would have never imagined becoming friends with non-humans would be possible!"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_113,Humans. You are here again. Why?
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_114,If you have no business. Don't talk to me.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_115,... Why me? Accept the condition. There are bad Neru. Outside of here.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_116,Excellent job. Taking care of them. I am impressed. You are truly strong.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_117,"The gift. Is very nice. Why, why? But I'll take it."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_118,A return gift. For the gift before. Humans are. Very peculiar. Their interests are. So strange ...
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_119,He's always the first one to head out. I can't keep up with him!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_120,"Sorry, I can't believe that monster got me ... I have to keep getting stronger."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_121,Someday I'll go meet the Neru who gave me that gift.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_122,This place is a dream come true. There are relics hidden away everywhere.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_123,There are so many places that have yet to be pioneered. I'm excited to see how many more relics can be found!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_124,I love thinking about the memories that relics hold more than anything else.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_125,The view here is something else. I wonder if it was any different in the past.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_126,"I've been walking around myself, but it hasn't been going well."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_127,You have an undeniable knack for finding relics. But I'm not giving up either!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_128,Those monsters sure have a lot of vigor ... But we can't just hand over the settlement's food ...
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_129,They're awfully crafty. They even avoided my tried-and-true trap.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_130,"Sorry, I wish I could dish out the punishment myself, but I'm not a fighter ..."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_131,They haven't shown their faces lately. I can finally get to working in the field.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_132,"I hope Mallon's okay. If a monster attacked her, I don't know what I'd do!"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_133,"Aren't you happy that your family got bigger, Mallon?"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_134,My little baby knows where home is!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_135,My darling Mallon and Lulu and Momo and Roro! I'm so glad everyone is okay!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_136,Tiara was always happily flying around here!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_137,None of my babies have gotten lost since you found them!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_138,Meow?
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_139,*Hiss*
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_140,"Sorry, this is my bad. Resources are so strained at the moment, so your help is appreciated."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_141,"No matter how short-staffed we may be, we at least need to prepare a place to eat and sleep."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_142,"By the way, my hobby is fishing. I can't catch anything around here though."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_143,There may have been a wall between the newcomers and me. I'll be sure to talk to them myself from now on.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_144,The first encounter with monsters in Aladiss. One could call that a newcomer's rite of passage.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_145,"Alchemy sure is handy. At the very least, you've definitely helped me out with it."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_146,You can make some good food with herbs.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_147,Muscles can also be of use to the Research Team! They cry out with joy!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_148,Being in Aladiss feels like I'm in a fairy tale. Maybe I'll write a book when I go home.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_149,"If you can also find it in Eustella, it can hardly be called a delicacy."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_150,A delicacy's taste doesn't matter. It's the rarity of the ingredients—that's what makes a true delicacy.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_151,"Did you try a delicacy? How was it? You're completely obsessed now, aren't you?"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_152,"Did you find ingredients for a delicacy? If it's something I've yet to taste, all the better!"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_153,"If the diets of humans and the Welleks are different, then the world of delicacies must be very deep indeed."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_154,"I will. Help my friends. Regret, regret. My friends. Other Neru."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_155,"I don't want to. Fight other Neru. But, I have a duty. To protect my friends ..."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_156,We need weapons. And armor. We will fight.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_157,We will. Protect our friends. Even if it's sad. It is our duty.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_158,"Crap, I was too careless!"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_159,Ugh! Ow ow ow ...
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_160,"The pain's better now, thanks. Watch out for those weird rocks yourself, okay?"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_161,"If the big, big monsters weren't so scary, we wouldn't mind living together."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_162,This is the first time in this investigation that I've seen a monster so terrifying ...
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_163,"Even if I can't get my research notes back, they're not worth losing my life over."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_164,All this work is making me hungry.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_165,So this should go ...
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_166,Well done. On the fight. I'll keep my promise. I'll take it.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_167,Applying pressure is doing nothing to soothe the pain!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_168,"That monster ... It'll get what's coming, I swear!"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_180,"I appreciate the help, but do you have a way to get medicine?"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_181,I hope monsters don't attack again. At least until things get back on track ...
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_182,"I've been managing the relics from various areas that have been brought in. I have to say, they're all extremely fascinating."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_183,I've heard that humans are quite dexterous. I'd like to see that skill firsthand.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_184,The Neru must be as worn out as we are. I wonder how much longer our fight will last.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_185,"Now, let's fix this device!"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_186,Maybe just a few more adjustments ...
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_187,It should work now!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_188,"Actually, let's think about it a little more."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_189,"We can't just leave things in a mess after there's been an attack. Sorry, but would you be able to lend a hand?"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_190,Everything that got broken needs to be repaired. Thanks for the help!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_191,How's everything going so far?
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_192,"Thank you so much for all your help! Here, take this. You deserve it."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_193,I'm glad we've gotten that stage done. Now we'll just have to make preparations before the next attack.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_194,I'm counting on you.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_196,This place is a scary place.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_197,They say it's cursed. Cursed!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_198,"How much longer, how much longer? How much longer until I get some yummy food?"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_199,The yummy food made me so happy. Thank you!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_200,There's a harbor and a nice view here. I've taken a liking to this place for sure.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_201,"It's tiring work, but we need to quickly improve the area and turn it into a place where people can relax."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_202,We need to prepare so that the other members can come by any time.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_203,You might be able to find some clues about the Harvest Project if you go to the school.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_204,"I see, so there wasn't anything there, huh? Sorry for saying stuff without anything to back it up."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_205,I hate when my stomach's all rumbly. I want to eat a bunch of yummy food!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_206,"So much food, yippee!"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_207,"Even if I can't read them, flipping through books is fun! I think they look cute all lined up in a row too."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_208,I love cooking. Please get me lots of ingredients!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_209,I can make a lot of foods and desserts! Woo hoo!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_210,Please get rid of the scary monsters!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_211,"Beautiful flowery clothes, please!"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_212,I want a cute plushie!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_213,"No, no! This isn't right!"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_214,"Thank you, nice Tall One!"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_215,I'd be happy if you took care of a lot of them.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_216,Just how delicious could this super yummy nectar be?
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_217,"A super cute one, please!"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_218,"No, no, no! If it's not cute, I don't want it!"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_219,I'm glad you Tall Ones are so kind.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_220,"Even when I rest, I just can't stop thinking about work for some reason ..."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_221,"Whew ... I thought I felt refreshed when soaking in the hot spring, but ..."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_222,That hot spring is something else! I feel light as a feather now!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_223,"A few more days of rest and I'll be back, hard at work for the Research Team. Thank you so much!"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_224,"If I'm just going to be staring into space, it makes no difference where I am."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_225,"We'll take on the task of finding the spring, so don't forget that armor, please."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_226,I'm looking forward to the hot spring.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_227,"I'm no longer tired, but when I think about what I have to do after my break is done ... *Sigh*"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_228,"When I think about coming back from my break, I get excited."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_229,"I want to go investigate all sorts of places, and then once I'm tired, take another nice dip in the hot spring."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_230,"I know that I'm asking for a lot, but ... *Sigh*"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_231,Everyday has been so tiring since coming to Aladiss.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_232,"But thanks to the hot spring, my body feels refreshed for the first time in a while. It's great!"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_233,I would be happy to see many Tall Ones come here again. Just like they used to so long ago.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_234,Wow! So many Tall Ones!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_235,"Apparently, there was a biiig hot spring. But I don't know where it was exactly."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_236,"Everyone is all smiles in the hot spring. It's so, so great."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_237,"Sorry for the trouble, but thank you."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_238,"Well, having a weapon will make investigating easier, so why not."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_239,Not having to sleep out in the open certainly sounds nice ...
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_240,I really think Licht must be part of some royal lineage. He just feels that way.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_241,"Well, looking for that item is important after all. I'm counting on you."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_242,A weapon made by an alchemist ... I'm getting excited just imagining it!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_243,Having even a simple base would put my heart at ease.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_244,I'd like to live in a territory ruled by nobles like Licht.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_245,Good grief ... I'm sorry to trouble you like this.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_246,I'm interested in seeing what kind of weapon an alchemist will make. I'll be waiting with bated breath!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_247,"It doesn't have to be perfect, just something we can use."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_248,Licht sure is a man of mystery. I'd like to get to the bottom of all his secrets someday.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_249,I'll be waiting here!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_250,"No need to rush. Research requires patience, after all."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_251,"Once you're ready, give me a shout, okay?"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_252,If only there was some kind of way ...
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_253,Sorry to take up your time.
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_254,Is it ready already?
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_255,"That's fine, no need to hurry."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_256,It huuuuuurts! Moooooommyyy!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_257,"Pull it together, you wimp! Fighting monsters means that you're going to get a little scratched up!"
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_258,Wh-whoa! It doesn't hurt anymore!
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_259,"Honestly, I can't thank you enough for everything. That should help everyone on the team do their jobs without worrying."
STR_NPC_SUB_MESS_260,"The magnificent design tempts the imagination to ponder history, every detail bold and innovative ..."
STR_NPC_SHOP_MESS_000,"Sorry, we're not open yet."
STR_NPC_SHOP_MESS_001,Come back when the store is open.
STR_NPC_SHOP_MESS_002,"I'm sorry, the store is still being set up."
STR_NPC_SHOP_MESS_003,Too bad. The store isn't open yet.
STR_NPC_SHOP_MESS_004,We're a little out of stock. Come back another time.
STR_NPC_SHOP_MESS_005,We're not open right now. Come back when it's open.
STR_NPC_SHOP_MESS_006,"Ah, sorry. We're still getting ready right now."
STR_NPC_SHOP_MESS_007,"We'll be opening the store soon, so I'll be looking forward to seeing you then!"
STR_NPC_SHOP_MESS_008,"Sorry, we still haven't opened the store."
STR_NPC_SHOP_MESS_009,We're out of stock. Come back when we're ready.
STR_NPC_SHOP_MESS_010,"Sorry, come back when we're open."
STR_NPC_SHOP_MESS_011,We're getting ready! We'll see you when the store opens.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_000,Thanks in advance.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_001,"Thanks, that really helps!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_002,Did you find everything?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_003,I'm counting on you!
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_004,"Thanks, that's such a big help!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_005,Did you get it all sorted out?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_006,You're sure there isn't something you could do?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_007,"Well, let me know if you change your mind."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_008,Yep. We sure live in a harsh world.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_009,Hmph. That's just cold.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_010,I-I can't thank you enough! I'm forever in your debt!
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_011,Did you get it done?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_012,*Sigh* ... How do I get out of this one?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_013,"Thanks, that was a close call."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_014,Oh ...
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_015,"Sure, I hear you."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_016,"What to do, what to do ..."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_017,Sorry to have been a bother.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_018,"Great! Well, isn't that just perfect!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_019,"Ah, I see. Let me know once you've got things settled then."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_020,<CLY2>Hmm ...<CLY1>
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_021,<CLY2>Ehehe ...<CLY2>
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_022,"<CLY2>Hey, you!<CLNR>"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_023,"<CLY2>Oh, what to do ...?<CLNR>"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_024,<CLY2>This sure is a tough one.<CLNR>
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_025,<CLY2>Heeeeey!<CLNR>
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_026,<CLY2>Oh ...<CLNR>
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_027,Is everything ready?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_030,"My shed's roof is leaking something awful, so I've been gathering up lumber to repair it."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_031,Would you happen to have any to spare?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_032,"Thanks, now I can finally patch those holes."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_033,"I don't suppose you'd be willing to lend a hand with the actual labor, too?<CR>... Nah, don't worry. I was just pulling your leg."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_035,"I'd like to head back to base, but monsters are blocking the road. There's probably no easy way out of this one ..."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_036,"They look pretty strong, too. Be careful out there."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_037,You got rid of them all? Thank you! Now I have nothing to worry about.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_038,"I won't be going out after dark again, that's for sure."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_040,"I've been searching all over for aqua ore, but I've barely found any."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_041,"I wonder if someone else simply beat me to it ...? Either way, this is quite the pickle."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_042,"Thank you, that's very kind. But, why do you have so much of this to start with?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_043,"... My, isn't that suspicious."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_045,"My partner's gotten injured, but we don't have enough medicine to treat the wound ..."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_046,Really? You'll prepare some for us?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_047,"Thank you, I'm in your debt. We'll hurry on back to base as soon as we're able."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_048,"Still, this isn't the sort of medicine you see every day. Will it really ...? No, ignore me."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_050,Urrrgh ... I feel awful ... My head's ... spinning ...
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_051,"Ngh ... I'm feeling a little better now ... Thanks, I'll use this chance to make my escape."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_052,"No, don't worry ... I'll make it out of here on my own, somehow."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_054,"Eeehehe ... You there, young lady! Would you like to hear something interesting?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_055,"There's a sprawling forest northwest of here. Ehe, and when night falls ... IT comes out."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_056,"If you're feeling curious, why not go see it for yourself? Eeehehe ... After dark, remember."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_058,"... Goodness, an incredibly large Puni has taken up residence near the bridge. If you feel up to the task, would you mind exterminating it?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_059,"Run away if things get dangerous. Life is precious. You only have one, after all."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_060,My! You got rid of every last one! Please take this gift as thanks.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_061,"You've done everyone a great service, and proven your strength in the process."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_063,"I've been thinking of making my daughter a hair ornament as a souvenir, but I need some princess grass. Would you be able to get me some?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_064,How much did you manage to get?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_065,"Oh, wow! Thanks, that's more than enough! Here, take this as a reward!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_066,I'll get started on that hair ornament tonight! I can't wait to see her ...
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_068,What is it? I'm busy. I'm gathering native plants for a study.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_069,"Hmph. You squandered my precious time, so I'll have you make up for it. Bring me some wing plants."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_070,"Did you get them? Come on, don't keep me waiting. I haven't got all day."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_071,"Hrm ... They aren't in the greatest condition, but I suppose they'll do. Here, your reward."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_072,"If you ask nicely, I might even consider making you my assistant. Plants are interesting, you know?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_074,"I heard that there's a flower that grows in this area called a Solflower. Doesn't that sound like the most beautiful thing? I'd love to see one, just once."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_075,Where would you even find one?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_076,... This isn't what I thought it would look like at all. But thank you.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_077,Trying to imagine things you haven't seen is more fun anyways.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_079,"Aaaaagh, I'm so mad! I fell while being chased around by those jellyfish! The absolute nerve of them, I swear!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_080,"You there! If you have time to spare, would you mind telling them off for me?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_081,"You put them all out of my misery! Tch, serves those monsters right. Here, take this as thanks for turning my mood around."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_082,"Ah, that's such a relief. Those meddlesome jellyfish should have known better than to pester ME!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_084,"You sure like hangin' 'round these parts, huh? Well, I've got just the rumor for you!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_085,"There's s'posed to be a huge bird that shows up by the waterfall to the east—but only in the dead o' night. Whaddya think? Neat, huh?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_086,"You think I oughta go check it out? Nah, that's too scary for my likin'."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_088,"You've seen the assembly hall that's a ways south of here, right? Well, I've heard some strange noises coming from there at night ..."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_089,It shouldn't exactly be in active use ... Would you be able to do me a favor and check it out?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_090,I can hear what sounds like metal creaking and all ... so I'm a bit too frightened to check for myself.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_091,"Hm? It was a bunch of strange knights loitering around? ... Sorry, I'm going to pretend like I never even asked."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_093,"I can't hear you, lalala!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_095,We don't have nearly enough stone to reinforce the buildings against all the monster attacks.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_096,"If you can help gather some stone, I'll make sure that you're appropriately compensated!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_097,"Thank you for your assistance! Please, take this as a reward."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_098,I hope you won't mind if I ask for more help in the future!
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_100,"You know, it's my dream to open a flower shop back home. I don't suppose you'd mind helping me gather a whole bunch of flowers?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_101,"Oh, wow! There are so many of them! And they all smell wonderful, too. Thank you! Take this, with my gratitude!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_102,"I hope you'll come visit my shop, too!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_104,"I've started running in the morning as part of my training, but lately a lot of strong-looking monsters have been showing up on my route!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_105,"I really liked that trail, too ..."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_106,"Whoa, you took care of those monsters? I need to thank you for that! Here, you can have this!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_107,"Huh? What use is my training if I can't beat them up myself? ... Yeesh, that's harsh."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_109,"You there! What do you think of this mushroom? Stunning, isn't it? And this streamlined shape ... Not to mention its beguiling scent!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_110,"Mushrooms each have their own unique quirks! So, what do you say? Want to trade me a mushroom?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_111,"Something as pretty as possible, please and thank you."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_112,"Ooooh! Now, that is something else! I'll trade for it!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_113,"Yes, gorgeous. Simply divine ..."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_115,"Hm? I thought I'd heard something, but I didn't realize anyone was living here."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_116,"I'm in charge of managing materials for the Research Team, and we're running a little low on ore. Would you happen to have any to spare?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_117,"Thank you for considering it, at least. And only if you have any extra!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_118,"Thank you so much! ... This should keep me from getting yelled at. Hm? Oh, sorry. I'm just talking to myself. Don't mind me!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_119,"You really did save me a ton of trouble. I might have to drop in again sometime, tee hee!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_121,Did you happen to find it?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_122,"Well, that's all right."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_123,<CLY2>Haaaaah ...<CLNR>
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_124,"I'm not too pleased, you know!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_125,I'll leave it to you!
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_126,<CLY2>Honestly! The nerve!<CLNR>
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_127,That's ... Y'know ...
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_128,"Tch, you're no fun."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_129,Could you maybe do something about that?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_130,Hmm ...
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_131,Thanks! I'll be counting on you!
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_132,Well? Did you get it all sorted out?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_133,I suppose there's no helping that ...
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_134,Please and thank you!
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_135,You've already gotten everything?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_136,<CLY2>Would you happen to have a minute?<CLNR>
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_137,"You'll really go take care of that? Thanks, that's a huge help!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_138,Hmph. You just don't get how great this is.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_139,Oh! Is everything good to go?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_140,"Oh, my! Did you get it all sorted out?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_141,You're awful! You cheapskate! You downright devil!
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_142,<CLY2>Hmmmm?<CLNR>
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_144,I haven't been sleeping too well lately on account of all the early-rising monsters.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_145,"There aren't that many of them, but it's not something I can handle on my own. I know it's not the most thrilling work, but would you mind lending a hand?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_146,"Please, I could really use the help!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_147,Thank you very much! I think I'll be able to rest easy for a while.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_148,"*Yawn* ... Actually, now that all the monsters are gone, I'm going to go have a nap."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_150,"There are an awful lot of monsters roaming around here at midday. So much so, that we have to go take them down on a regular basis."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_151,"Thankfully, they're not all that strong. It's more that their numbers are the issue, so could you help thin them out?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_152,Not enough of them have been eradicated. I'd like to see a little more effort.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_153,"Your assistance was much appreciated. If you ever have the time to help out again, by all means."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_154,"We should be fine for now though. If anything comes up, I'll let you know."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_156,"U-um, I was hoping that you might be able to help me with some gathering. Ideally, I'd like to finish up before morning ends."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_157,Please! Just grab as much as you can before the monsters wake up!
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_158,"S-sorry, I'd really like a little more!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_159,Thank you very much! That was such a big help!
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_160,"I'm fine for now, thanks! If I need any more, I'll let you know."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_162,HELLO! SORRY TO BOTHER YOU SO SUDDENLY! WOULD YOU HELP ME WITH SOME GATHERING?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_163,"I WOULD DO IT, BUT I'M NOT THE STRONG, SILENT TYPE! MONSTERS WOULD BE ON ME LIKE STINK ON A PIG!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_164,"PLEASE, I COULD REALLY USE THE HELP!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_165,"THANK YOU SO MUCH! IF I EVER NEED HELP AGAIN, YOU'LL BE THE FIRST PERSON I ASK!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_166,HEY! TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF!
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_168,Nightfall is the time for thrill-seeking adults. Would you like to hear more?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_169,"As for the request, I'd like some of THAT. You know, the thing that makes adults more chic and charming."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_170,I was hoping you'd put in a little more effort.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_171,"My goodness! You really got some! Thank you. You should be a step closer to becoming an adult now, too."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_172,Tee-hee! I don't have any work for you right now. Maybe later?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_174,"Apparently, there's a dangerous monster that makes its home in manabound areas. Would you be able to take one down for me to use as a sample?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_175,Make sure not to do anything without proper preparations though!
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_176,"Don't worry, there's no rush. Take all the time you need."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_177,This is a marvelous sample! Thank you very much!
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_178,"You didn't get hurt, did you? Go on, take a good, long break."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_180,"There are all sorts of rarities lurking in manabound areas. I know this is a rather dangerous request, but perhaps you'd be willing to accept it?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_181,"I'd accompany you, but my lower back is killing me ... I'm sorry for the trouble, but I really do appreciate the help."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_182,It's fine to take all the time you need.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_183,"Oh! This is just what I was looking for, thank you!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_184,"When this pain of mine goes away, I'll head out there with you! Look forward to it!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_186,"The other day, I saw the biggest monster ever! If that thing comes over here, we'll all be in big trouble!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_187,"It's making me seriously nervous, so would you mind taking it out? Thanks!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_188,"The faster you take that thing down, the better! I'm counting on you!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_189,"Wow, you really did it! Thanks! Now none of us have to worry."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_190,"If anything else comes up, I'll let you know!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_192,"I saw the strangest monster the other day. I'll tell you where, so would you go check it out for me?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_193,"I didn't get a very good look at it, so I can't say if it was a strong one or not. Whatever you do, stay safe, all right?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_194,"Did you happen to spot it? Well, assuming that it hasn't gone anywhere else."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_195,You found it and safely struck it down? Wonderful! Was it anything unusual?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_196,"Has anything changed since then, I wonder? Well, if something comes up, I'll be sure to let you know!"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_198,"There was an attack, but no one's been out to deal with the aftermath yet. Sorry, but would you be able to lend a hand?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_199,Everything that got broken needs to be repaired. Thanks for the help!
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_200,How's everything going so far?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_201,"Thank you so much for all your help! Here, take this. You deserve it."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_202,I'm glad we've gotten that stage done. Now we'll just have to make preparations before the next attack.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_205,I'm so hungry ... Do you have any food?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_206,"That would be too good to be true, huh ..."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_207,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_208,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_209,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_210,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_211,I don't feel so great ...
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_212,I'm all out. Could you get some more ready for me?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_213,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_214,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_215,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_216,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_217,"Hey, are you that alchemist? I heard you can make anything."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_218,I really want this thing ... Do you think you could make it for me?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_219,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_220,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_221,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_222,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_223,"You sure can gather all sorts of things here. Say, do you have a minute?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_224,I need help gathering. I'm a little low on what I need.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_225,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_226,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_227,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_228,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_229,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_230,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_231,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_232,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_233,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_234,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_235,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_236,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_237,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_238,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_239,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_240,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_241,"I'm collecting ingredients from a certain monster, but it's taking a lot of time."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_242,"If you can bring me the ingredients, I'll give you a little something as thanks."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_243,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_244,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_245,You really helped me out. I hope we meet again.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_246,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_247,"Hey, do you have a second?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_248,"My equipment got damaged while I was investigating, so I'd like to replace it. Do you know anybody who could help with that?"
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_249,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_250,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_251,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_252,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_253,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_254,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_255,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_256,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_257,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_258,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_259,Can we talk for a minute?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_260,"Where did you all get your gear? It's like ours, but something is different ..."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_261,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_262,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_263,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_264,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_265,If only there was a way to beat them and keep moving forward ...
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_266,Can I ask you to take care of the monsters near here? I'll tell you exactly where they are.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_267,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_268,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_269,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_270,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_271,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_272,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_273,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_274,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_275,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_276,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_277,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_278,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_279,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_280,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_281,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_282,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_283,You all. Have strange clothes.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_284,Give us. One too.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_285,I will wait.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_286,"Beautiful, beautiful."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_287,"Thank you, thank you."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_289,"Outsiders, outsiders."
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_290,Bring me. Ingredients.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_291,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_292,This will do.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_293,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_295,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_296,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_297,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_298,You were. Very helpful.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_299,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_301,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_302,Do you know. The outside world?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_303,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_304,I have never. Seen this before. I'm glad.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_305,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_307,How do you. All fight?
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_308,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_309,
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_310,You have brought. A good item.
STR_NPC_QUEST_MESS_311,
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_000,I hope the investigation goes well.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_001,This place is in absolute shambles. Just what happened here?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_002,Even the environment here is something else. We need to watch out for monsters.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_003,"Now then, what was my next job again ...?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_004,I should look over the investigation report soon.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_005,Be sure you don't neglect your reports.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_006,"Oh yeah, we ran out of bandages. I need to get some more."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_007,The chief asked me to do a supply check. I'd better finish soon ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_008,No time to stand around and talk. I've got a lot of work to do.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_009,"Go on, you should get to work too!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_010,It's a tough job coordinating all the adventurers. I swear they're going to be the death of me.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_011,I joined the knights because I look up to the chief. I want to be like him someday ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_012,My clothes are all tattered ... Maybe Isla will fix them for me if I ask her.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_013,Can we save the talking for later? I have a mountain of things to do.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_014,"Giving orders to adventurers, checking the investigation reports ... Busy, busy."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_015,I need to get my body moving. I wonder if Viktor is up for a quick spar.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_016,I hope my family back in Eustella is doing okay ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_017,I think I'm a little homesick. How are you holding up?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_018,"I have some free time, so maybe I'll train. The monsters around here are tough after all."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_019,"It was a lot of work to get here, so I need to achieve something worthwhile."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_020,Why would the chief let someone like this in the Research Team ...?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_021,"If you so much as blink wrong, I'm reporting you to the chief, got it?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_022,Don't go off on your own. It's scaring the other members.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_023,"I'm sorry, but could you please find someone else to talk to?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_024,The alchemist! D-do you need something from me?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_025,You're bothered by how everyone's acting toward you? I'm afraid there isn't much we can do about that.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_026,The reason? You know the reason. Don't make me spell it out.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_027,I'm counting on your help moving forward. Just ... no funny business please.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_028,"I heard this from the chief, but there's a monster that can talk?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_029,Hurry up and do something about it. Isn't that why you're here?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_030,"I still don't trust you, you know. Let me see more of who you really are."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_031,"It's nice that you want to be helpful to everyone, but try not to make trouble for Viktor and the others."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_032,"It seems that Isla and the others trust you, but I'm not convinced."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_033,"Err, Yumia, was it? D-do you need something?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_034,Never thought there'd still be people living in Aladiss ... What a shock.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_035,"It's amazing that the Chief can stand up to the leader of the Welleks, don't you think?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_036,"I'll accept you as a member of the Research Team for now. ... Just for now, though!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_037,"To be honest, I was a little afraid of you at first."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_038,But it's different now. I've seen enough to know that your commitment to our efforts is genuine.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_039,"Is anything troubling you? If you need help, feel free to ask us!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_040,"Alchemy can be used to make weapons, right? Can you show me sometime?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_041,"The chief called you brilliant the other day. I have to say, I agree."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_042,"I was unsure how things would go at first, but we've come so far now."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_043,"That's all thanks to you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_044,It feels like our Research Team has really come together.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_045,You're all always so perfectly in sync with each other. I can tell you really get along.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_046,I'm glad you joined the Research Team. Let's see this through to the end.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_047,"Once our investigation is over, I'm going back to Eustella to see my family. I'm so excited!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_048,"Hehehe, I'm definitely gonna find some amazing treasure during this investigation!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_049,Then my name will go down in history as one of the great adventurers of our time!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_050,"My dream of coming to Aladiss came true. Even if I don't find any riches, I'm satisfied."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_051,Why did I join the Research Team? None of your business.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_052,"If I can show off during this investigation, I'm sure to become popular!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_053,The Research Team has so many annoying rules. This is why I hate organizations.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_054,Maybe I'll just ditch the mission and go explore over there instead ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_055,"Oh my, did you hear that? Promise me that you won't tell the knights? Pretty please?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_056,There are so many monsters here! This place is the worst. Don't you agree?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_057,I have to be sure to document everything I've seen here.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_058,I want to publish my adventurer's log someday so that lots of people can read it.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_059,"Just to keep things clear, I have no intention of working together. All the treasures here are mine!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_060,The adventurers here all seem like they have some kinda baggage ... You the same?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_061,"No, never mind. I'm not gonna pry. I have my own things I'm dealing with, so we're in the same boat."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_062,Sheesh ... Why do I have to listen to the knights' orders?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_063,"Hey, you. Would you mind writing my investigation report for me? It's such a pain."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_064,"Hm? You don't want to? Come on, pretty please?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_065,"The knights seem like they have it tough too. Well, not that I really care."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_066,Aladiss is a surprisingly easy place to live.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_067,The place where I adventured before this was really rough.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_068,I read a lot of historical books about Aladiss before coming here ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_069,But my time here has been way more interesting than anything that was written in them!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_070,I've really taken a liking to Aladiss. So much so that I hope our investigation never ends!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_071,"Unlike everyone else, I still haven't found a single piece of treasure!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_072,It's like the treasure hates me ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_073,"The young adventurers have absolutely no manners ... You aren't like that though, right?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_074,"Chief Erhard sure is cool. He has a kinda mature air about him, you know? I really look up to him."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_075,"I came here to make money, but I sure am getting tired of exterminating monsters every day."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_076,"You might not believe it, but I'm a pretty famous adventurer. ... Huh? You really don't know me?!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_077,"I love the thrill of being here in Aladiss. You were getting bored of plain old Eustella too, right?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_078,"Most adventurers sure are oddballs. ... Wait, no! That doesn't include me!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_079,I actually volunteered for the Research Team along with a friend of mine ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_080,But only I got accepted. I wonder if he's doing all right ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_081,I can feel my muscles growing thanks to all my encounters against the monsters.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_082,I can't wait to go back home and tell everyone what I've seen here.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_083,I used up all my savings preparing for this investigation. But I don't regret it one bit!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_084,This is actually my first time adventuring. Hm? You too?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_085,"Ah, I forgot to report to the knights earlier. Oh well, whatever!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_086,The best adventurers from all over Eustella have gathered here! So awesome!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_087,This is my first time participating in an investigation like this. It's more exhausting than I thought.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_088,"Yikes, I just locked eyes with the alchemist! I'm gonna get cursed!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_089,... Whoa! Wh-what is it?! Don't talk to me outta nowhere!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_090,"I don't care if you're an alchemist or whatever, I'm still gonna show you up."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_091,"*Sigh* I'm starving. Hey, do you have anything to—"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_092,"Oh, never mind. I'm fine actually ... Getting something from an alchemist is a bit scary."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_093,"Oh, right. Can you tell me about alchemy? I want to write about it in my adventurer's log."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_094,"It's like a curse, right? Have you ever used it to put someone in danger?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_095,"Everyone is cautious of you, but I don't really care that much."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_096,"You're a real alchemist, right ...? N-never mind, I didn't mean anything by that."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_097,"I know it's for the sake of the investigation, but relying on the power of the taboo rubs me the wrong way ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_098,"Hello there, great wielder of the forbidden arts. I'm expecting big things from you, okay?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_099,"U-um ... You aren't going to curse me or anything, right?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_100,"Some monster called Vesper showed up, huh? If I had been there, I wouldn't have let it escape."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_101,"I thought there was no such thing as alchemists for the longest time, so I still can't trust you."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_102,You sure can get things done. Seems I underestimated you a bit.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_103,"So you were saved by Nina, huh? She's so strong and cool!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_104,It hasn't been so bad working with an alchemist.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_105,"Sorry, if you need something, can it be saved for later? I've got some things I'm mulling over right now."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_106,"I've talked to Rutger a few times, and I've got to say ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_107,"He's got a foul mouth, but he's actually pretty earnest."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_108,Alchemist ... Is it really okay to trust you?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_109,You managed to clear the manabound areas? You're definitely no ordinary person!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_110,"I'm counting on you, Alchemist. Pave the way for us."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_111,"I don't care if you're an alchemist. As long as you don't get in the way of my quest, that is!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_112,"To be honest, I've misjudged you quite a bit ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_113,"You really are amazing, I'll admit it! I can see why the chief called you in."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_114,"Hey, haven't you been pushing yourself a bit too hard lately? I'm worried about you."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_115,I've gotten used to Aladiss now. But I do miss the hustle and bustle back home a bit.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_116,Looks like you young'uns are hard at work yet again. I could learn a thing or two.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_117,I've been feeling uneasy lately ... What? Sleep deprivation? If you say so ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_118,Uh ... I'm sorry. I really misunderstood you before.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_119,I kept doubting you just because you're an alchemist. I feel embarrassed looking back on it.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_120,"I used to always adventure alone, but having companions isn't so bad."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_121,"Alchemy sure can make all sorts of different stuff, huh?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_122,If all alchemists were people like you ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_123,Then maybe Aladiss wouldn't have turned out like this.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_124,"Yumia, you helped me realize something. Alchemy isn't always something to be afraid of."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_125,I never would have believed that I'd get to see the capital one day. It's all thanks to you.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_126,Having so much fun each and every day on an adventure is a first for me. It's all because you're here.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_127,I want to show my appreciation somehow. I'll try to think of something before this investigation comes to an end.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_128,You have the makings of a real adventurer. How about being an alchemist by day and adventurer by night?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_129,"Don't forget, Alchemist. You're a part of the team too!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_130,I've written down your exploits in my adventurer's log. I've got to tell everyone about them!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_131,We finally made it to Calumna. But just making it to the capital isn't the end! Let's keep pushing even further!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_132,"These jobs from the knights are so boring. Hey Yumia, how about we both sneak away?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_133,I need to pick up souvenirs to bring back when I finally go back to Eustella.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_134,The time between the beginning of our investigation to now feels like it happened in the blink of an eye.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_135,I'll always treasure the adventure I've had here with everyone on the Research Team.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_136,Our research is tied to Eustella's future. There's no job more meaningful than this.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_137,"Life returns to the earth and mana is created, supporting our everyday lives ... It's a beautiful cycle."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_138,I can't wait to tell my students about the things I've seen and heard here!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_139,"Exploring, researching, writing reports ... I'm so busy! But it's fun!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_140,Our investigation and pioneering are what give our time here meaning.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_141,"I'm in charge of the thinking, not the carrying. So look lively and bring me some research materials!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_142,You can ask me about anything you don't know regarding Aladiss.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_143,"... You can ask, but no guarantees! There's a ton I don't know either!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_144,Newer equipment would give us more accurate information ... If only we could get the budget.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_145,"When I investigate the eating habits of monsters, I get hungry too ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_146,The monsters of Aladiss seem to have created their own unique ecosystem.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_147,"There are some ferocious ones out there, so be careful. Our investigation will come to a halt if you all get hurt."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_148,"If I find a new species of plant or animal, maybe I'll name it after myself."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_149,Memory Vials are so useful. We can hear what people said long ago as if they were talking today.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_150,"If these were in Eustella, who knows how much historical research would have advanced ... Oh, I'm so jealous."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_151,A researcher gathering research material might be akin to an alchemist gathering ingredients.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_152,Hehehe ... If only those fools who expelled me from the academy could see me now.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_153,"If I don't write some kind of useful paper here, my lab will run out of funding ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_154,"We're counting on you, Miss Alchemist! I mean it!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_155,I-I ... I've always wanted to talk to you ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_156,Flammi! Please teach me how to decipher the contents of those Memory Vials!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_157,Choosing what to learn from your predecessors and what to reject is important.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_158,Are you interested in taking part in an experiment? I want to check the effectiveness of a new medicine I made.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_159,"Ah, don't worry! It's safe! ... Probably."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_160,"If you find something, would you mind letting me know? Just me! No one else!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_161,What's the difference between an alchemist and a regular person? I wonder if we could find out by running tests.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_162,"If we knew everything about the world, it'd be so boring. Being able to figure out new things is the fun part."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_163,We can learn about people's lives in the past from the things they've left behind. I became a researcher because I love that moment of discovery so much.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_164,Please keep in mind that we are surveying a precious continent. Try not to damage the land needlessly.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_165,"Alchemy, mana, sudden destruction ... What in the world happened here?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_166,"You're the one from the rumors? I'm interested in the taboo arts ... But no, I shouldn't ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_167,This is the Ligneus region. The land is covered in lush vegetation. We might discover some new species here.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_168,Aladiss is full of new discoveries. It's a paradise for researchers.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_169,Alber are so cute. Always taking good care of their hats.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_170,"I swear, those relic hunters! They shouldn't be taking relics without letting them be inspected first."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_171,There's a lot of vegetation here. I wonder if that's always been the case.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_172,"Investigating Aladiss used to be just a dream ... Mom, I'm going to make the most of this opportunity!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_173,"When I get lost in my research, sometimes Isla comes and checks up on me. I appreciate that."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_174,"You're that alchemist, right? Good luck investigating. We'll be giving it our best too."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_175,"Since the land was destroyed, I had some worries, but at the very least, the water ain't poisoned. That's a relief."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_176,I get really down when my research isn't progressing well ... I should take some cues from the Alber.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_177,This is the Sivash region ... There's not much information left about it.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_178,Apparently there's a school in this region. I wonder what was taught there.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_179,I wonder if the way a Welleks's fur grows changes depending on where they're born ... So fluffy ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_180,"So, I heard that there was a talking monster ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_181,"But did it seem like it could make complex vocalizations like singing? Did it have a tongue, vocal cords, and vocal membranes? I'm so curious ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_182,The area ahead of us is shrouded in mystery ... Who knows what kind of research material we might find.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_183,"There are more research materials about the Alber language now! ... Though, I'm the only one researching it."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_184,"We need to be careful that our research does not disturb the locals here, like the Alber and the Welleks."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_185,To think that the vegetation varies so much between regions ... I should quickly summarize it in a report!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_186,"The metal tree, Pergrica Turm ... I am once again baffled by the strange vegetation of this place."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_187,This is the Auruma region. It seems it was quite a developed area in the past.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_188,Producing technologies and products comes with great responsibility. We scientists must keep that in mind.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_189,Was this once an industrial area? There are a lot of places that give a sense of past prosperity.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_190,Mana born from memories ... Does the quality of mana differ between races?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_191,Alstahlia nectar ... It's quite interesting to learn it can be used in this way.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_192,"The more I learn about alchemy, the more I'm surprised by its usefulness."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_193,... But why did it become taboo in the first place?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_194,You want. You need. A new tool? We don't have. Any budget ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_195,"... Agh! I've been talking to the Neru so much, their speech patterns are rubbing off on me ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_196,Buildings that haven't been touched by humans in ages shouldn't be in such good condition. It sure is eerie.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_197,We're finally here—the Lacuna region. This was once Aladiss's capital ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_198,It's great that these old buildings from the past civilization remain ... But it's a little creepy.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_199,I have family back in Eustella. I have so much I want to tell them about.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_200,"After my travels, I'm going to write a paper on alchemy. I don't like how misunderstood it is."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_201,"Will you help with that, Miss Alchemist?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_202,"How could such an advanced civilization fall to ruin? Learning the truth is scary, but still ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_203,Thank you for all of your hard work. I hope we'll stay in touch even after the investigation is over.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_204,"It's great to be the one who discovers something, but sometimes it's best not to publicize it."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_205,I respect whatever choice you all make. Let's work hard and see this investigation to the end.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_206,"We're investigating the unknown, so there's no telling what lies ahead. Try not to get hurt, okay?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_207,Viktor is always so diligent. Doesn't he ever get tired?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_208,I read your research journal. Please try to write a little more legibly.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_209,"If we could use Memory Vials to record our voices, don't you think clerical work would be a breeze?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_210,The amount of time it takes to get materials from Eustella really is a problem.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_211,Making sure that the base is comfortable for everyone is also one of our duties.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_212,"Okay, so that's the food we have left. Now to just stock up ... Gah, it's way over budget! Everyone eats too much!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_213,The knights are too rigid and the adventurers are too wild! They both need to consider the other's perspective ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_214,A boisterous atmosphere is a sign that people are happy. It's nice.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_215,"I want to help the chief out, even if only a little. But I don't know what I should do ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_216,"Do anything suspicious and I'm reporting you, Alchemist."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_217,"... The relief team has enough help. You can stay back, Alchemist."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_218,"Rutger, was it? He seems a bit unwell every now and then. I hope he's all right."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_219,"I'm up to my ears here ... Ah, the alchemist! N-no, we don't need any help right now ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_220,"Nina, the mercenary. Composed and powerful. I've never spoken to her, but I admire her."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_221,"We have an alchemist in our base ... It's no good, I just can't bring myself to accept it."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_222,"Alchemist ... You're always working hard, aren't you?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_223,"In my time interacting with the residents of Aladiss, I've learned a lot from their different housing sensibilities."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_224,"I really enjoy your research journal, Yumia. I think I'll grow to like Aladiss."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_225,"If something happens, you can call on the relief team. N-not that I'm worried about you ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_226,"The monsters are getting stronger, and injuries are increasing. The relief team is in complete chaos."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_227,"I think almost everyone recognizes your good qualities, me included. ... So don't overwork yourself."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_228,"When I go back home, I'll proudly tell everyone that I got to know an amazing alchemist!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_229,"May everyone return safe and healthy! You too, Yumia!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_230,I heard that you lost your memories. Are you feeling all right otherwise?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_231,"I see ... That's good. Thank you for everything you've done, Yumia."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_232,"Always smiley, warm, and snug!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_233,The field is breezy and fluffy. It feels good to take a nap in!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_234,Eek! Please don't touch my hat!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_235,My tummy is rumbly ... What should I eat today?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_236,My hat is my treasure! So I keep it nice and new!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_237,I've never seen a Tall One before. I'm glad to meet you!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_238,"There's a bunch of stuff that's fallen on the ground. I'm good at finding it. How about you, Tall One?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_239,Tall Ones all wear that red cloth. It's cool and stylish!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_240,Depressing things? ... What does that mean? I don't get it.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_241,"When the drip-drops fall from the sky, it's all splish-splash-splosh. It's fun!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_242,"I want to know everything about Tall Ones. Teach me, okay?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_243,How long have we been here? Since forever and ever ago!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_244,"On top of a mushroom, puff puff! Itsy-bitsy floating fun!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_245,Tall Ones are biiig. I wonder what you can see from up there.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_246,I get scared and shaky when there are lots of monster around. I have to move quietly carefully.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_247,"Plod plod, step step, let's walk! I like making footprints."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_248,"After a long day's work, I sleep so snug. Then I'm wide-awake in the morning!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_249,"""Dense man-a-bound a-ree-ya""? Nope! I don't know about that."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_250,"Are there more of us back where you're from, Tall One? I want to meet them someday."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_251,Why are our hats different colors? It's more fun that way!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_252,"Singing a song makes me feel good! Will you sing with me, Tall One?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_253,"After reading a story, I have shiny, amazing dreams."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_254,"Welleks? You mean Fuzzy Ones? I like them, they're soft and fuzzy!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_255,Fighting with everyone? What's fighting?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_256,Is my hat cute? Hehehe!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_257,I like both warm and cool places!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_258,"What are you holding, Tall Ones? Weapon-pons? Cool!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_259,"Twinkly, pointy, and metally! The leaves here are so pretty."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_260,So many Tall One buildings. Which ones are houses?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_261,"So many scary monsters ... Be careful too, Tall Ones."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_262,"Ingredients in the pot simmer and swirl, and once it's ready, I'm super happy!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_263,"Cooking is fun! Tall One, do you like cooking too?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_264,I woke up bright and early with Mister Sun. Today is a good day!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_265,Tall Ones work so hard all the time. Sometimes it's good to relax and take it slow.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_266,I heard this place used to have lots and lots of Tall Ones.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_267,"The wind is fun! Whoosh, whoosh! I wonder what tomorrow's wind will be like?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_268,I'm super-duper tired today. But that makes my food super-duper tasty!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_269,Your story got me all excited! I want to go and see the world like you Tall Ones!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_270,"I heard there are ghosts here. Scary, scary!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_271,What if I get eaten? It would be terrible if the ghost got an upset stomach.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_272,"Tall Ones like everyone, don't you? I do too!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_273,"I'm so shocked! Look at all these shiny buildings! They're all so, so big!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_274,"I play hide-and-seek here. Sneaky sneak, so exciting!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_275,"Tall One, your birdie stitch-stitch is so fluffy and nice."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_276,"... Have you always had it? If it has lots of memories, it's even nicer."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_277,"Are you going home, Tall One? Come again, okay? See you!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_278,"Thank you for helping everyone. I love you, Tall One!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_279,"Tall One, your red cloth is all tattered. You must've been working hard!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_280,... *Sigh*
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_281,Unbelievable. Never thought outsiders would come here.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_282,Humans ... Why have you come here?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_283,"No, get away from me!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_284,It's a bad omen for humans to come here out of the blue ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_285,The power to dispel the forbidden lands? I'm not going to fall for the lies of an outsider.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_286,"Human, I'm sorry for ignoring you before. ... You don't remember that? Oh ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_287,"Cledia is so cool ... You think so too, right?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_288,"I don't mind you being here, just don't start any trouble."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_289,"Oh, it's you humans. Work hard today."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_290,Welleks love to live modestly. There's no need for wealth or fame.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_291,"Ugh, this humidity is ruining my tail fur ... I'm jealous of your silky hair."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_292,"Welleks are good at hunting. Well, I guess it's more like hunting is necessary for our survival."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_293,Thank you for taking back the cathedral. It has invigorated our prayers.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_294,You only have one Welleks in your group? Oh ... she must be lonely ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_295,I was worried for a moment. I'm glad there's no need to fight the humans.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_296,"Human lady, do you find Welleks unusual? From my point of view, you're the ones who are unusual."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_297,"How's that investigation thing going? If there's anything we can do to help, let us know."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_298,I heard the news. You've been going around helping all over the settlement.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_299,Talking to humans like it's nothing out of the ordinary is a weird sensation.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_300,"Looking up close like this, I notice that human faces are actually quite similar to ours."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_301,So you're the human that cleared the forbidden lands. You look like a normal girl to me.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_302,"Um, listen ... I'm sorry about my bad attitude before. It was my first time meeting an outsider, so I was scared ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_303,"In our settlement, you're an outsider. That won't change ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_304,"Thank you for clearing the forbidden lands. You'll be staying around here for a while, right?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_305,My brother is one of the new hunters ... I heard that you saved his life.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_306,"You all came from really far away, right?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_307,I'm going to deliver lunch to my husband who's out hunting. Can't catch anything on an empty stomach!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_308,Humans sure wear all kinds of different clothes. You and your friends look so different.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_309,Excuse me! Could you let me look at you for a moment? I'm really interested in humans ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_310,"We have this chance to get to know each other, so let's get along."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_311,"But I'm not afraid. You've all been a great help to us, after all."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_312,Don't worry about it. I want to lend you a hand.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_313,Thanks. You're a good bunch.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_314,"Plus, who would've thought that it would be so fun. Humans are good at making conversation."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_315,Your face in particular looks exactly like my daughter's! Would you line up side by side with her later?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_316,"Oh sorry, I'm not doubting you or anything. I just thought it was strange."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_317,"... I'm really sorry! I promise I won't act that way anymore, so please, let's talk again sometime!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_318,But I think you're an outsider who we can trust.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_319,"In that case, may I ask you for your name? I can't just call you ""Miss Human."""
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_320,"Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'm so glad that you came here!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_321,"If you don't mind, please tell me about your travels."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_322,"You're eating well too, right? Kids have to eat!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_323,They look great on you all! I think it's lovely.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_324,"And if possible, I'd love to talk ... B-but if you're busy, that's fine!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_325,It's best to avoid senseless fighting.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_326,"As we're unfamiliar with each other, let's maintain a proper sense of distance."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_327,That's what Cledia ordered.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_328,I guess we have no choice but to repay the favor.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_329,You lot are more reasonable than I expected.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_330,"But that doesn't mean much. Humans are humans, Welleks are Welleks."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_331,I mean ... I guess I believe you.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_332,I know now that you aren't our enemy.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_333,But I don't mind having you around for a while.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_334,Make yourself comfortable.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_335,Um ... Thank you very much! I thought that it would be proper manners to tell you that in person.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_336,"Seriously, just what is your goal here?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_337,"Well then, you take care now."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_338,"If I record this, maybe it'll be useful someday."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_339,"I'll be sure to thank you properly, so what do you say? Huh?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_340,"... If you have no particular business, don't talk to me."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_341,"Sorry, but I'm busy preparing for a hunt. I don't have time to talk to an outsider."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_342,Phew! Today was another big haul!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_343,The prey we usually hunt are like babies compared to monsters.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_344,"What? If you have no particular business, don't talk to me."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_345,I'm going out to hunt now. I hope to get at least ten kills out there.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_346,Let me thank you for your help at the cathedral. We couldn't have done it without you.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_347,Your weapon ... is that a staff? I've never seen anything like it.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_348,"Thanks to you clearing the forbidden lands, we can go out farther to hunt."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_349,... It's not that I hate you. I just hate being any more friendly than I have to.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_350,What kind of meat do you like? I'll hunt some for you.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_351,"If you all need anything, I'll be sure to help out."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_352,How do you fight? Would you please show me?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_353,My heart races when I go down an unknown path. I understand why you all are on a journey.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_354,"I'll lend a hand when needed. That should be good enough, right?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_355,Cledia's orders. I'll share with you.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_356,... It's disgraceful.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_357,It wouldn't be good to fight with humans right now. Cledia's judgment is correct.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_358,I'm grateful for that. Thank you very much.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_359,You must be tired from your long journey. Please rest here as best you can.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_360,Thank you. We were able to take back our sacred place of prayer thanks to you.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_361,Differences between races mean little. The place of prayer is open to all.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_362,Close your eyes and quietly feel the mana in the air around you. That is how to pray.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_363,"Let us pray to atone for the sins of our ancestors, as well as for peace on this day."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_364,"Kind travelers, may the road before you shine true."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_365,"Humans, humans. So rare. What. Do you eat?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_366,Neru respect manners. Visitors. Are welcome.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_367,You are. Similar to us. You have. A staff.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_368,"Monsters are. Dangerous, threatening. You all. Be careful."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_369,I want power. And strength. Tell me about. Your weapons.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_370,A human. With a spear. Has been asking us. About clothes. And accessories. What are those? I don't know ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_371,"Long ago, in the past. There were. Many humans. In this land. Why they disappeared. Is a mystery ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_372,We want to. Protect this place. Every day. We train. Every night. We train.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_373,"Human. What are ""songs"" like? I'm curious. I want to hear."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_374,"This land, this place. Is harsh. It rejects us. But we only have. This place ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_375,That toy bird ... It's cute. I want to know. How to make one.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_376,The village. Gatekeepers. Work in shifts. It's my turn. Ugh ... I don't want to.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_377,"We hate, despise Welleks. This feeling. Will last forever."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_378,We are. Completely different. From monsters. We can talk. To humans.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_379,... We and the Welleks. Hate each other. We cannot stand. Poverty.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_380,"Nectar, nectar! This is. What we wanted. Thank you, thank you."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_381,"The nectar is. Plentiful, abundant. Our future is. Secure."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_382,"Happy, overjoyed! We have nectar. We have. So much nectar!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_383,We have nectar. We can explore. We can learn about. This land. I'm excited. I can't wait.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_384,Humans. Thank you. For coming here.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_385,"Humans. About yourselves, tell me."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_386,"Come here, how did you? Your journeys, you must share."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_387,"Many monsters, this land has. Take care, you must."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_388,"Cause of destruction? Aladiss? Apologize, I must. Know, we do not."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_389,"Respect our chief, I do. Our shining light, they are."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_390,"Your way of talking, I like. To talk with humans more, I want."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_391,"Always praying, we have been. So that continue living in this land, we may."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_392,"About my treasure, can I brag? About this necklace. Collected pretty metals, I did."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_393,"Different weapons, humans each have. My own staff, I'm starting to want."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_394,"Restless, we are. Because humans we saw."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_395,"Shiny things, I'm collecting. If you see any, please tell me."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_396,"This mask, I like. Want to try it on, do you?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_397,"Come from where did you, humans? Outside Aladiss? Imagine that, I cannot."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_398,"See and learn of this land, I want humans to. The hardships of our homeland, you will know."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_399,"Like their companions as well, humans do? ... I see. The same, we are."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_400,"To the Blessed Land, our master has not come in a while. What has happened, I wonder."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_401,"Become unneeded, tributes have. With our time now, what should we do?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_402,"Purified, the land has been ... Outside of Auruma, can we go?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_403,"Seeing you fall into the lake, shocked I was. Feeling fine now, are you?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_404,"Gone, gifts and tributes are ... Change from now on, will our lives?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_405,This place is a scary place.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_406,They say it's cursed. Cursed!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_407,"How much longer, how much longer? How much longer until I get some yummy food?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_408,The yummy food made me so happy. Thank you!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_409,There's a harbor and a nice view here. I've taken a liking to this place for sure.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_410,"It's tiring work, but we need to quickly improve the area and turn it into a place where people can relax."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_411,We need to prepare so that the other members can come by any time.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_412,You might be able to find some clues about the Harvest Project if you go to the school.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_413,"I see, so there wasn't anything there, huh? Sorry for saying stuff without anything to back it up."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_414,I hate when my stomach's all rumbly. I want to eat a bunch of yummy food!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_415,"So much food, yippee!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_416,"Even if I can't read them, flipping through books is fun! I think they look cute all lined up in a row too."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_417,I love cooking. Please get me lots of ingredients!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_418,I can make a lot of foods and desserts! Woo hoo!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_419,"The Harvest Project, a plan to do our part to create and enrich various things ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_420,People back in the day sure had some interesting ideas.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_421,"After hearing about the Harvest Project, I started to think about making things myself to help."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_422,"I'm kind of bad with my hands, so it's not going so well ... But I'm sure if I keep trying, I'll succeed eventually!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_423,Please get rid of the scary monsters!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_424,"Beautiful flowery clothes, please!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_425,I want a cute plushie!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_426,"No, no! This isn't right!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_427,"Thank you, nice Tall One!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_428,I'd be happy if you took care of a lot of them.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_429,Just how delicious could this super yummy nectar be?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_430,"A super cute one, please!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_431,"No, no, no! If it's not cute, I don't want it!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_432,I'm glad you Tall Ones are so kind.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_433,"Even when I rest, I just can't stop thinking about work for some reason ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_434,"Whew ... I thought I felt refreshed when soaking in the hot spring, but ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_435,That hot spring is something else! I feel light as a feather now!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_436,"A few more days of rest and I'll be back, hard at work for the Research Team. Thank you so much!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_437,"If I'm just going to be staring into space, it makes no difference where I am."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_438,"We'll take on the task of finding the spring, so don't forget that armor, please."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_439,I'm looking forward to the hot spring.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_440,"I'm no longer tired, but when I think about what I have to do after my break is done ... *Sigh*"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_441,"When I think about coming back from my break, I get excited."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_442,"I want to go investigate all sorts of places, and then once I'm tired, take another nice dip in the hot spring."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_443,"I know that I'm asking for a lot, but ... *Sigh*"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_444,Everyday has been so tiring since coming to Aladiss.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_445,"But thanks to the hot spring, my body feels refreshed for the first time in a while. It's great!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_446,I would be happy to see many Tall Ones come here again. Just like they used to so long ago.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_447,Wow! So many Tall Ones!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_448,"Apparently, there was a biiig hot spring. But I don't know where it was exactly."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_449,"Everyone is all smiles in the hot spring. It's so, so great."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_450,"After hearing about this hot spring, I knew I had to visit!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_451,Time for a little rest and relaxation!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_452,The hot spring here is incredible ... They should have one in the base.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_453,"Sorry for the trouble, but thank you."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_454,"Well, having a weapon will make investigating easier, so why not."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_455,Not having to sleep out in the open certainly sounds nice ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_456,I really think Licht must be part of some royal lineage. He just feels that way.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_457,"Well, looking for that item is important after all. I'm counting on you."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_458,A weapon made by an alchemist ... I'm getting excited just imagining it!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_459,Having even a simple base would put my heart at ease.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_460,I'd like to live in a territory ruled by nobles like Licht.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_461,Good grief ... I'm sorry to trouble you like this.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_462,I'm interested in seeing what kind of weapon an alchemist will make. I'll be waiting with bated breath!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_463,"It doesn't have to be perfect, just something we can use."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_464,Licht sure is a man of mystery. I'd like to get to the bottom of all his secrets someday.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_465,Wilma said she would leave for another country as soon as the investigation was over.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_466,"As a fellow scholar, I'm a little jealous. I wish I had that much initiative ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_467,I haven't seen Licht lately. Is he off investigating somewhere?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_468,"You don't happen to know where Licht is, do you? I have something I'd like to ask him to investigate ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_469,I read Wilma's report on the Alber. It was quite interesting.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_470,So much so that I might go do a little research on them myself.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_471,Whew ... I'm saved ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_472,You saved me ... Thank you.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_473,Sorry to make trouble for you ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_474,"Well, that was rough ... Please, take this as thanks."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_475,I can never thank you enough. Please accept this as a token of my gratitude!
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_476,Things should be all right now thanks to you all. You have my thanks.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_477,"Heeey, over here!"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_478,Good afternoon to you all.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_479,Are you working on investigation duties as well?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_480,I made too much. Please have some.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_481,You have some food too.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_482,"We're all on the same team. Please, eat."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_483,What is this ...?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_484,Hmm. This is ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_485,What to do ...?
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_486,"If you need this, you can have it. I'm sure it'll be of more use to you."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_487,There are some samples left over. You can take some with you if you'd like.
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_488,"I found this while out investigating. If it looks useful, why don't you take it with you?"
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_489,"Now that I think about it, I feel like that girl said she wanted to borrow a Nectar Bottle ..."
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_490,There are Alstahlia flowers with the energy taken out of them on the ground ...
STR_NPC_MOB_MESS_491,...

STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_000,"If the preparations are complete, then let's get started."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_001,"That weapon ... You're completely sure it's safe, right?"
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_002,I expect that you'll use your power to aid the Research Team.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_003,Your ability to clear the manabound areas is indispensable to the Research Team.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_004,Let's keep on clearing manabound areas in order to expand the range of our investigation.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_005,To think that monster really was in Aladiss ...
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_006,"We'll definitely cross paths again. And when that time comes, I'll definitely ..."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_007,We can't be sure that your mother is the one who stopped the disaster that happened in Duerer.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_008,... I hope that this investigation will lead us closer to the truth of what happened on that day.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_009,"It was the perfect opportunity to take my revenge, but I couldn't do anything while facing him ..."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_010,I must become stronger ... and I must defeat Vesper.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_011,The Silva ... It's surprising to find that Welleks still live in Aladiss.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_012,But I am pleased that they are willing to hear us out. It's important that we have good relations with the locals.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_013,"That monster hates us ... No, it'd be more accurate to say she hates alchemists."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_014,"Be on your guard, Yumia. Of course, we'll do our best to protect you."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_015,Unimaginably strong enemies are lurking in Aladiss.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_016,We have to be more vigilant than ever before going forward.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_017,Nina was made by alchemy ... A homunculus ...
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_018,"Sorry, can you give me some time? I need to get my thoughts straight."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_019,"The sudden news was a shock, but it doesn't change the fact that Nina is one of us."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_020,"The time we spent together was real, after all."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_021,"If only I had been able to protect you back then, this wouldn't have happened ..."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_022,"Just as you did for us, now we will point out the way for you, Yumia."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_023,"I don't want you to lose your way. As your friend, at least let me keep you from straying."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_024,"Looking at this city, I'm reminded how little I really know about alchemy."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_025,Alchemy can be a terrifying thing when it's in the wrong hands.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_026,"It should be used properly, like how you do."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_027,"At last, Isla and I can truly move on with our lives."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_028,After coming all this way I finally feel like I've gotten used to being a Research Team member.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_029,"Now then, the only problem remaining is Basilius. Let's focus and track him down."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_030,"Even though we've cleared the manabound areas and investigated up to the capital, there's still so much to do."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_031,A different kind of hectic than what we're used to lies ahead of us.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_032,"I apologize for the inconvenience, but I really appreciate it."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_033,Let's just think of it as practice at first. We should go try it out on some nearby monsters.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_034,Take your time.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_040,"If you need help with anything, just ask. I'll help in any way I can."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_041,What are weapons made from alchemy like? I can't wait!
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_042,"I can't say it too loudly in front of my brother, but ... alchemy is amazing!"
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_043,"Where did that monster go? ... No, it doesn't matter."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_044,"We have Yumia, after all! Wherever it went, it can't hide."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_045,Hmph ... I don't like people with bad attitudes and even fouler mouths.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_046,But I can't say anything if we're working together ... It puts me in a bit of a bad mood.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_047,"If Nina hadn't been there, we would've been ..."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_048,I must become stronger ... Strong enough to defeat Vesper.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_049,Has Lenja been on her own this whole time?
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_050,"I know Welleks have impressive physical ability, but ... isn't that dangerous?"
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_051,Mutants ... Maybe that's how Vesper became a monster too.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_052,"... No, I have my thoughts about Lili Borea, but that guy is different."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_053,"Whatever his reasons, I'll never forgive him for what he's done."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_054,It's not like every mutant is like Vesper and Lili Borea.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_055,If only they were as friendly and open to talking as the Geni ...
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_056,"... They have their own reasons for fighting. If they won't surrender, we'll have to make them."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_057,"Sorry, can I have some time to myself? I want to think about Nina."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_058,"How I feel about Nina hasn't changed, homunculus or not."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_059,She's always been there for us! She's a great and reliable friend!
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_060,"Yumia, um ... Actually, never mind ..."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_061,Seems like you've gotten your cheeky side back as well.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_062,But I'm relieved. I like you this way.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_063,"Vesper is out there, right? Somewhere in the capital ..."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_064,"I wasn't able to do anything last time, but this time, I'll definitely take him down ..."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_065,I joined the Research Team so I'd have a chance to take down Vesper.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_066,But there's still a lot left for the Research Team to do.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_067,I really want to see it through to a happy ending.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_068,I finally feel like I can focus on the future now.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_069,To think I didn't have any cloth! Me of all people ...
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_070,Thanks so much! Please let me know when you get those hides!
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_071,Sorry to be such a bother.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_072,"If I'm going to fight, I wanna look gorgeous doing it is all! I'm not upset about anything."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_073,Sorry to make you do this for me!
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_080,"So, when're you gonna show me some alchemy? Not that it's probably anythin' to act all important about."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_081,You're pretty reliable after all. I guess alchemy ain't just for show.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_082,I heard the gist of things from the noble boy. So that monster wrecked your home.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_083,"I don't plan on stickin' my nose into other people's pasts, so whatever your goal is, just do what you like."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_084,What now? I already told you about myself. Don't try to get any more involved.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_085,"Rather than fuss over me, shouldn't you be directin' your attention to that suspicious girl?"
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_086,"She may be a klutz, but she's still a Welleks."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_087,"As a member of the Research Team, she needs to do her job properly."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_088,... What's with that look?
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_089,"Don't brood over it too much. It's not like you did anythin' to her, right?"
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_090,Change up your attitude before it comes back to bite you.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_091,"I knew somethin' was up with that mercenary woman, but I never would've thought she was a homunculus ..."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_092,"She may be created from alchemy, but that doesn't change what she is to us one bit."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_093,"Homunculus or whatever, who cares? That's not what's important."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_094,What we should be thinkin' about is whether she can help the Research Team.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_095,"... You haven't forgotten anythin' else besides your mother, have you?"
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_096,Think back on your memories as far as you can.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_097,Don't lose sight of what's precious to you.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_098,"With or without your memories, you're still you and your life isn't over."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_099,"If you've got time to sit around and mope, you've got time to learn somethin' new."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_100,... That's how I've kept on livin'.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_101,"Your mom, huh? ... I don't know what to say. I don't remember mine either, after all."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_102,Nothin' will come of agonizin' over it. You just have to take what you have and move forward.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_103,"It's great that the capital's bein' restored and all, but couldn't they restore some valuables as well?"
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_104,"Then when we go back to Eustella, I'd be the richest man alive ..."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_105,"... What? Nothin' wrong with that plan, is there? It's important to think of what comes next."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_106,I don't care about whatever Basilius is tryin' to do.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_107,There's just one thing I need to do ...
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_108,"And if he gets in the way, I'll bring him down. That's all there is to it."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_109,We've made it through so many unbelievable things.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_110,"So I'm sure whatever lies ahead will work itself out. That's life, right?"
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_111,... What? Just leave me be for now.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_112,It'd better be secure! I won't accept anythin' shoddy.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_113,"I don't like puttin' my stuff on the floor. Hurry it up, will you?"
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_114,You're weird.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_120,"You might be surprised to hear this, but I'm pretty popular among my fellow mercenaries."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_121,I'll try to live up to your expectations.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_122,"Perfect mana flow, huh? That's better than her saying it was a mess."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_123,Lenja sure is cute.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_124,I'm so glad that she's traveling with us.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_125,And that means I get unlimited access to all of that fluff. *Chuckle* Maybe I should go give her a pat right now ...
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_126,"Alchemy holds a dark past, having created mutants ..."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_127,Investigating Aladiss means confronting that history head-on.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_128,"I don't think that I need to tell you this, but don't avert your gaze."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_129,Making it all the way to Auruma means that the capital isn't much further.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_130,I read about it in a book. One about the geography of Aladiss back in the day.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_131,"... I'll talk about everything with the chief. Don't worry, I'm not going to run."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_132,"Even though I had my reasons, it doesn't change the fact that I've been hiding things from everyone."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_133,I'm sorry that I've been deceiving you this whole time ...
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_134,"If no one can trust me anymore, I understand. It's my fault and I deserve it."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_135,"Even though I've caused all this trouble, you're still willing to forgive me and call me your friend ..."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_136,I won't hide anything from you all ever again. I'll tell you everything I know.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_137,I trust you all. I think of you as my precious friends from the bottom of my heart.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_138,"If there's anything I can do for you ... Never mind, I'm sorry."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_139,Nothing can replace the precious memories of a loved one.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_140,... I know that well.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_141,"If you decide that you want to move forward, I'll be there to help you."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_142,I think that's the best way I can support you.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_143,"If it wasn't for you, I never would have heard those words from Doctor Marina ..."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_144,"This might sound like an exaggeration, but it saved my life ... That's how grateful I am."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_145,Thank you so much. Thank you for letting me hear the doctor's ... my mom's words.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_146,It's too bad that my first home is no longer there ...
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_147,But it's odd that the capital was restored by so much in the first place.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_148,I've received the doctor's message. There's nothing more I could want.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_149,I think I can get by in the mercenary business no matter where I go.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_150,So I plan to travel the world and see all sorts of places.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_151,"I don't know if it will be helpful or not, but I'll share some of my techniques with you."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_152,"It might be somewhat of a hassle since your bullets are different than mine, but give it a shot."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_153,I'm excited to see how the place for drinking delicious tea will turn out.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_154,"If you could prepare a few of them, that would be a big help ... I'm not asking for too much, am I?"
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_155,*Chuckle* Please let me know when it's ready.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_160,"U-um, I ... Uh ... I'll do my very, very best!"
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_161,"A talking monster ... No, that's not right. A human that was changed into a mutant ..."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_162,She was so strong ... How many monsters like that are there here?
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_163,"L-lately, I think ... Maybe, I've become a little more ... confident. I guess ..."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_164,B-being praised really makes me want to do my best! That's how I've been feeling!
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_165,Miss Nina is a homunculus ...?
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_166,"... Sorry, I'm not good at sorting things out quickly ... Give me a little bit of time ..."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_167,It doesn't matter if she's a homunculus ... Right?
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_168,"I mean, Miss Nina is Miss Nina! The time we've spent together is real."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_169,There was nothing that needed thinking about.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_170,"Miss Yumia, I did sense that something about your mana was different ..."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_171,But I can't believe that you lost your memories of your mother ...
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_172,... If I had been stronger—if I had done more—this wouldn't have ...
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_173,You and Miss Nina are so strong ... I'm surrounded by incredibly strong people.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_174,I need to learn from everyone. I want to become strong too.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_175,I'm glad that Miss Nina was able to hear her mother's message ...
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_176,It kind of made me want to go see my mom too.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_177,"I admired both you and Miss Nina ... I mean, I still do."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_178,But ... I'm not like the two of you. I'm going to try to become the me I want to be!
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_179,"And I, um ... Of course I'd be happy if someone said I was cool, or something like that ..."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_180,There's only a little left until we reach Basilius ...
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_181,"No, it's too early to get all gloomy."
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_182,It's the Research Team's job to see the investigation through to the end!
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_183,I want to hurry home and show everyone the new Lenja.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_184,"I'll tell them, ""I grew a lot during my adventure!"""
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_185,P-please bring some pretty flowers!
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_186,"Did you think of something, Miss Yumia?"
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_187,Y-you really made it for me?
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_188,I-it's okay. I'll be waiting here.
STR_NPC_MAIN_MESS_189,"I'll wait here for you all to come back. So please, go on ahead."
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_000,"Have you written today's research journal entry yet? If you let them pile up, it'll only become more troublesome."
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_001,Training is always of vital importance. I have to get stronger so I can protect everyone ...
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_002,"Tomorrow morning, should I train, get some tasks out of the way, or read a book? ... Hmm, this is a tough one."
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_003,I hope everyone back in Duerer is doing okay.
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_004,"If you ever need help with physical labor, leave it to me. Building, carrying, you name it!"
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_005,I have to protect everyone in an emergency. As a knight of the Order of Eustella ...
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_006,"Erhard is incredible ... He has so much work on his hands, but never lets it show."
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_007,"She may not seem like it, but Isla can be sensitive. I'd appreciate it if you treated her with care."
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_008,Is there anything bothering you? I'll help you out in any way I can.
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_009,You never know where danger might be lurking. Let's proceed carefully.
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_010,"*Sigh* I want some new clothes soon ... But being here and all, the only option is to make them myself, isn't it?"
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_011,I took a quick look around and didn't see any monsters. Safe and secure!
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_012,I wanna take a bath ... But that would be a luxury in this kind of place.
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_013,"Aaah, I'm so tired! My brain is telling me it requires sweets!"
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_014,My brother has always been reckless. Can't leave him alone for a second.
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_015,I think the secret to success lies in how much fun everyone is having. That goes for our investigation too.
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_016,"If there's something you need help with, let me know! I can at least lend an ear."
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_017,Phew ... Being able to just space out and not worry about anything ... It's the best.
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_018,What kind of clothes were trendy in Aladiss? I wonder if there are some old pictures or paintings left behind.
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_019,"All right, maybe it's time for a little spear training. I can't let myself be a deadweight, after all."
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_020,"Man, I'm starvin'. Anythin' is fine, I just need food ..."
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_021,"Ah, somethin' just moved over there! ... The hell, just shadows playin' tricks on me."
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_022,I hate wastin' time doin' nothin'. We should get movin' as soon as everyone's rested up.
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_023,"What do you want? If it's just some borin' chit-chat, go away."
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_024,I'm not gonna let some rules control me. I do things my own way.
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_025,"I wonder what kinda treasure is around here. If you see anythin', make sure to show me first."
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_026,"Ugh, why do I have to be here with these guys ...? I'll remember this, old man."
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_027,I don't take to the battlefield for show. I'll at least make sure to protect you guys.
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_028,"It's important to be efficient when takin' on monsters. Make sure you're usin' your head in battle, yeah?"
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_029,I actually like this continent. There's definitely no shortage of surprises.
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_030,"Say, why don't we both sneak out of here? ... Just kidding.<CR>*Chuckle* It was a joke."
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_031,*Chuckle* What is it? Is there something on my face?
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_032,"Are you feeling tired? If you are, it's perfectly okay to get some rest."
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_033,I like the time that we spend resting together. I hope that you do too.
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_034,"Sometimes the monsters we come across are cute, right? I have a hard time finding the resolve to fight them."
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_035,Preparation wards off vexation. Make sure to plan ahead.
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_036,"The secret to strength? Good question ... Plenty of food and plenty of sleep, I suppose?"
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_037,"Ooh, Lenja's fluffy tail is wagging again! ... Oh no. I lost my composure again ..."
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_038,I have some time on my hands. Maybe I should try reading a book.
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_039,"Doctor, everyone ... I'm going to try to work a little harder."
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_040,Wah! Wh-what do you need from me?
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_041,I like to spend time grooming my fur. I get so happy when it's all pretty and clean ... Ehehe.
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_042,"My sword is cool ...? Uh, yeah! It's super reliable and great!"
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_043,I'm so happy. I get to work alongside all my wonderful friends here.
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_044,"I don't really like fighting ... But if everyone is here with me, I think I can give it my all."
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_045,I wonder if everyone back home is doing all right ... I might be just a little homesick.
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_046,Hyah?! It was like I could feel Miss Nina's gaze just now!
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_047,"*Yawn* ... Zzz ... Ah! S-sorry, I was so tired, I drifted off ..."
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_048,"You who inhabit the land, Harvest Deity. Please watch over us ..."
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_049,All of the fish in Aladiss are so good! I want to take a bunch back to Eustella ...
STR_NPC_CAMP_MESS_050,

STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_000,"Yumia can create tools by weaving memories together. This ability is known as ""alchemy."""
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_001,"Alchemy begins by choosing a <CLEG>recipe<CLNR> to make. You only have a few at the moment, but you can obtain more from a variety of sources."
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_002,"Let's try to synthesize a <CLEG>""Luft""<CLNR>, an air element attack item which Yumia already knows how to make."
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_003,<CLEG>Please select the Luft recipe.<CLNR>
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_004,This is a <CLEG>Memory Vial.<CLNR> It is an alchemical tool that can store memories.
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_005,The recipe for a <CLEG>Luft<CLNR> is recorded in this Memory Vial. Accessing it will start synthesis.
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_006,"The memory has been accessed and the <CLEG>Alchemy Core (""core"" for short)<CLNR> is now visible."
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_007,A <CLEG>core<CLNR> is an important memory that directly affects an item's strength. The goal of synthesizing is to strengthen this <CLEG>core<CLNR>.
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_008,The currently selected core is in an <CLEG>inactive<CLNR> state. This means its effects cannot be strengthened and the synthesizing process cannot continue.
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_009,"To proceed with synthesis, <CLEG>you must first activate the core by providing it mana from certain ingredients.<CLNR> Once it has been activated, synthesis can continue."
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_010,A Luft's core requires mana from a <CLEG>Pinwind<CLNR> to activate.
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_011,The Pinwind's mana has activated the core.
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_012,Activating the core has caused new things to appear.
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_013,"This is called an <CLEG>Alchemy Slot (or simply, ""slot"")<CLNR>. Like cores, slots can have ingredients added to them."
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_014,"This is a visualization of mana floating in the air. It is called <CLEG>Drifting Mana (""mana"" for short)<CLNR>."
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_015,Let's continue with the synthesis. <CLEG>Please select a slot.<CLNR>
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_016,The blue circle you see now is called a <CLEG>resonance area<CLNR>. Resonance areas occur when ingredients are added to slots and vary in size depending on the ingredients used.
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_017,"When the core, slots, or mana are within the resonance area, the finished product is enhanced. <CLEG>Please choose an ingredient.<CLNR>"
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_018,<CLEG>The mana inside the resonance area resonated and has been acquired.<CLNR> Acquired mana will accumulate and release its power once a certain amount has been reached.
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_019,"<CLEG>The core and slots have also resonated.<CLNR> They aren't acquired like mana, but by causing them to resonate, the hidden powers of the synthesized item can be unleashed."
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_020,"Once resonance is finished, the amount of mana acquired and the number of times the core and slots resonated are counted. <CLEG>The higher this count, the stronger the finished product.<CLNR>"

STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_035,"Once you've picked a recipe, you can choose your <CLEG>Passive Skills<CLNR>."
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_036,<CLEG>Passive Skills<CLNR> are skills with effects that need certain conditions to be met to be activated.
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_037,"After using a Passive Skill, the item-enhancing effect will activate if the conditions are met during synthesis."
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_038,"Using a Passive Skill requires you to pay the corresponding <CLEG>cost<CLNR>. If you can't pay the <CLEG>cost<CLNR>, then you can't use the skill."
STR_MIX_TUTORIAL_039,Try selecting a Passive Skill. It's also possible to synthesize without using one.

STR_MIX_DEFINE_255,Synthesizing Powerful Equipment
STR_MIX_DEFINE_256,"Quality represents an item's degree of perfection. The higher the quality, the more powerful the item."
STR_MIX_DEFINE_257,Quality increases drastically when using high-quality ingredients. It can also be raised by using a large amount of ingredients.
STR_MIX_DEFINE_258,"To increase quality, prioritize using ingredients with large resonance areas while synthesizing the Quality Alchemy Core. Causing multiple resonances will greatly increase quality."
STR_MIX_DEFINE_259,"It is recommended to use ingredients that have effects such as ""Synthesis: Quality Up"" if possible."
STR_MIX_DEFINE_260,"In order to increase quality during synthesis, you must have already unlocked the ""Quality Control"" skill on the Skill Tree."
STR_MIX_DEFINE_261,"An item's effects are unleashed when it is used. Effects are set individually for each item, and up to three effects can be added to an item by raising the recipe level at a Recipe Recall Station."
STR_MIX_DEFINE_262,Effects have levels that indicate their strength. A higher level means a more powerful effect.
STR_MIX_DEFINE_263,"To increase levels, prioritize using ingredients with large resonance areas while synthesizing the Effect Alchemy Core. Causing multiple resonances will greatly increase effect levels."
STR_MIX_DEFINE_264,"It is recommended to use ingredients that have effects such as ""Resonance Boost"" if possible."
STR_MIX_DEFINE_265,"An item's Trait Crystal slots indicate the maximum number of Trait Crystals that can be equipped to it. The more slots there are, the more Trait Crystals you can equip."
STR_MIX_DEFINE_266,"Up to three Trait Crystal slots can be added to each item. However, a large amount of high-quality ingredients are required to obtain all three."
STR_MIX_DEFINE_267,"When you want to add more Trait Crystal slots, prioritize using ingredients with large resonance areas while synthesizing the Trait Alchemy Core. Causing multiple resonances will increase the number of Trait Crystal slots available to you."
STR_MIX_DEFINE_268,"It is recommended to use ingredients that have effects such as ""Resonance Boost"" if possible."
STR_MIX_DEFINE_269,"At first, only one effect will be able to be added to each item, but raising the recipe level will allow you to add up to three effects to items."
STR_MIX_DEFINE_270,"Recipe level can be increased at a Recipe Recall Station, which can be placed in bases via Building."
STR_MIX_DEFINE_271,
STR_MIX_DEFINE_272,"Once a recipe level is raised beyond a certain point, additional slots will be added, allowing you to use more ingredients."
STR_MIX_DEFINE_273,
STR_MIX_DEFINE_274,"To raise recipe levels, you will need particles, which can be obtained from mana geysers that you find while exploring."
STR_MIX_DEFINE_275,Quality and effects are extremely vital to synthesizing powerful equipment.
STR_MIX_DEFINE_276,"High-quality ingredients are needed to make high-quality synthesized items, so be sure to prepare as many as you can!"
STR_MIX_DEFINE_277,"When making equipment, it is also important to use ingredients that have effects which activate during synthesis. Try to prioritize using ingredients with effects such as ""Synthesis: ATK Up"" if available."
STR_MIX_DEFINE_278,"Ingredients created via synthesis are called ""intermediary ingredients"" and are more powerful than those gathered normally."
STR_MIX_DEFINE_279,"Preparing a lot of intermediary ingredients will give you a big advantage during synthesis. Neutralizers are especially useful, so it is recommended to stock up on them if you have ingredients to spare."

STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_000,"A species of monster that can be found in all regions of the world. Weak and easily chased away from dwellings, they pose no threat whatsoever. They do occasionally fall from the sky on rainy days, so it's best to keep an eye out for any errant Puni."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_001,"A type of Puni that most commonly appears in fields and forests. If you happen to disturb one while it's sunbathing, it won't hesitate to roll after you in an aggravated huff. Even so, outrunning one of these is a simple enough task."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_002,"Red Puni burn with an inner blaze. While their exteriors aren't hot enough to cause serious injury, careless handling can cause burns. These little hellions are constantly seeking out new enemies to fight."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_003,"Purple Puni exude a pungent, herbal scent that quickly betrays their presence. Their breath is so strong-smelling that it can deal damage on its own."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_004,"Black Puni are good at hiding in darkness or shadow and startling those who draw near. Composed primarily of sludge, grime, and oil, they are, in a word, filthy. Expect battles with them to be downright dirty."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_005,"A pure white Puni without so much as a speck of dust. Lovers of cleanliness, White Puni will mercilessly attack anyone who mars their pristine form. They also enjoy playing tag with their fellows."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_006,"Clad in sparkling silver, these Puni are every bit as reflective as a mirror. While not as hard as actual metal, they are highly elastic, so ramming attacks made by these Puni shouldn't be taken lightly."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_007,"A golden Puni that dazzles with almost divine radiance. Although it's said that encountering one will bring luck with money, due to their strength and aggressive nature, it's much better for travelers' fortunes to turn and run than to stop and pray."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_008,"A Puni that shines with all the colors of the rainbow. When the sun hits one of these just right, the shades ripple and change, resulting in an awe-inspiring display."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_009,"A massive Silver Puni variant. Huge and deceptively solid, going up against one of these often feels like facing off against a clump of steel. It's quite intimidating when one rolls or hops close in the same manner as its smaller counterparts."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_010,"Gold Puni that manage to endure years of fierce battles eventually obtain this form. It seems to enjoy climbing onto anything with a similarly divine appearance, but to be climbed onto by this Puni would certainly lead to being crushed to death."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_011,"An extra-large version of a Rainbow Puni. Said to be blessed with an internal sun, this Puni can cast multicolored light in even the darkest spaces. It can sometimes be found with smaller Puni prancing around it."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_012,"A crystal monster with a ruby glow. Born from the magical power found in the crystals they are composed of, these creatures lack any real sense of self-awareness. They tend to endlessly move along the same route."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_013,"A monster created from chilly ice crystals. They blast living beings with cold air, freezing them and sucking their souls to fuel their own existence. When they stand still, they're almost indistinguishable from a regular block of ice, so caution is advised."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_014,"A crystal monster that springs up by absorbing the magical and mundane nutrients present in the ground. Able to communicate with any golems in their area, they can (and will) call for assistance in chasing down their enemies, if need be."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_015,"These monsters are created when a bolt of lightning strikes magic-imbued crystal. While they are exceptionally strong on their own, they also have the ability to manipulate golems, making them incredibly troublesome creatures."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_016,"While they resemble the red crystal monsters, some sort of effect has caused them to reach a tremendous size. Immensely powerful, this frightening monster's appearance heralds extreme destruction."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_017,"This bird uses its sturdy legs to race across the land. While it can't fly, it's no less speedy than birds who can. More often than not, though, it can be found leisurely preening its feathers."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_018,"This bird's prominent beak is its most unique feature. It is used both offensively and defensively, being both hard enough to repel bullets and sharp enough to pierce metal armor. These birds are often seen striking at ore deposits with reckless abandon."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_019,"This bird sports the finest plumage of all. While their feathers fetch incredibly high prices, their ferocious nature ensures that anyone hoping to gather them will be putting their life on the line. Those with the misfortune to stumble across a full flock will be mercilessly hounded by the screeching beasts."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_020,"A bird with bewitchingly glossy plumage. At first glance, the feathers appear to be soft, but they are actually as tough as scales. Many adventurers have been lured in by this monster's beauty, only to be trampled underfoot."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_021,"The fastest and largest variety of this monster species. In fact, it is the quickest land-based monster in the world. In addition to size and speed, the thrust of its beak is strong enough to pierce armor. Attempts to meet it head-on are, quite frankly, foolish."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_022,"A monster skilled at using the blazing-hot flames that cover its body to unleash devastating attacks. Raindrops evaporate as they hit this beast's pelt, causing steam to rise from its fur on damp days."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_023,A monster clad from snout to tail in gusts of wind. They motionlessly aim for prey and use those gusts to nimbly pounce with teeth bared. There are multiple reports of adventurers being knocked over by their sheer speed.
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_024,A monster that most closely resembles a walking ice sculpture. Its frozen fur serves as a solid defense against enemy attacks and grants extra strength to its barreling full-body assaults.
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_025,"A monster whose coat is perpetually charged with lightning. The electrical currents coursing through this beast are so strong that one strike would be fatal. They use their echoing howl to call their pack, alerting their fellows to the presence of anything worth pursuing."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_026,"A flying monster wreathed in flame. It is frequently seen floating around without its protective cloak, drifting by without a care in the world."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_027,"A flying monster that travels using cold air. While it has been spotted twirling around treasure chests, this behavior is both very rare and impossible to explain."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_028,"A monster that glides by using air currents. Although generally quite docile, anyone who approaches it will be welcomed with menacing cries and gale-force winds."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_029,"Only individual monsters of this species that are struck by lightning take on this form. Its many powerful techniques have earned it the nickname ""Lightning Incarnate."""
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_030,"An enormous, nocturnal bird monster. It seeks out its prey from the tops of trees or the open sky, launching swift sneak attacks on whatever catches its sharp eyes. Skilled sharpshooters who manage to hit one in flight will cause it to falter and drop closer to the ground."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_031,"A monster with red wings and a characteristic crest. It circles its prey from high above, striking with startling accuracy. Its sharp talons make short work of whatever it catches."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_032,"This creature prefers to lie in wait for its quarry from the treetops, swooping down the second it wanders into range. This fiendish winged monster is feared as the hunter of the skies."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_033,"This winged creature's feathers are as tough and heavy as stone. It is stronger and more aggressive than other members of its species, occasionally opting to attack its targets directly instead of sneaking up on them."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_034,"A small, rodent-type monster. Every day, they work on their den, constantly commuting from their ideal base of operations to lumber-rich areas. While watching these adorable creatures work is rather heartwarming, getting too close to one will result in a nasty bite."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_035,"A monster with particularly tough skin. A steady diet of ore has helped turn its body rock solid. It uses this trait to its advantage, curling up and rolling at enemies to attack them."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_036,"A monster with brightly colored fur that builds its den in flowery fields. Should something enter its territory, it will rear back on its hind legs, spreading its arms wide in intimidation. If that fails to dissuade the intruder, it will not hesitate to run and attack them."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_037,"This monster uses its vice-like jaw to gather the metal and ore with which it makes its dam. It takes much pride in its work, leading it to rage against anyone who threatens its dam, stubbornly driving them off."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_038,"A monster with an unusually large body. They are content to live anywhere quiet, be it on the ground or in the treetops. While they recognize other varieties of their species, everything else falls squarely into the ""prey"" category and will be attacked on sight."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_039,"A monster that has outfitted its head, arms, and other vital points with armor. They love nothing more than going on rampages, so if there is no prey nearby, they will clamber up a high tree to get a better vantage point."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_040,"A monster with a splendid set of armor. Aware of the importance of safeguarding vital points, they make sure to thoroughly cover them with sturdy materials. They let out roars of joy when they spot an enemy, beating their chests as they swoop in to attack."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_041,"A monster with a characteristically red body. They are incapable of relaxing and can always be seen roaming or running around. While their aggression is terrifying enough, their ability to hurl massive boulders at their foes as if they weighed nothing is just as horrifying."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_042,"A terrifying monster that cannot survive without combat. They are perpetually drenched in the blood of their enemies and refuse to go long enough between fights to let it dry. They let out a loud roar when they spot a new opponent, hurling themselves from the trees to attack."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_043,"A monster of advanced age that has honed its abilities over many years, with knowledge and skill that have placed it at the apex of its species. Neither its ferocity nor its strength have diminished, and it can frequently be seen roaring and beating its chest. It has also been said that it understands human speech."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_044,"A monster that carries a shell made of lumber it has gathered, which also serves as a den. It is fairly common and often found peacefully snacking near bodies of water."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_045,"As its name suggests, this monster creates and carries around a shell composed primarily of rubble from destroyed buildings. Hauling around all that debris has given it power without compromising on mobility. It will not hesitate to launch the debris located within its shell as an attack."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_046,"This monster's shell is made of gathered crystals. When they burrow into the ground, they appear to be a regular crystal formation, allowing them to lure in prey or avoid predation. Their claws are strong enough to cut through crystal, so they should be approached with caution."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_047,"A monster that gathers ore to make its shell. A scant number of them carry extremely rare ore, making them a favored target for adventurers. While it will do everything in its power to try and intimidate potential threats, approaching one generally results in it running away."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_048,"A monster that has formed its shell from wreckage harvested in ruins. They are often seen wandering around aimlessly, possibly due to having enough strength to live comfortably in such unforgiving areas."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_049,"This monster carries a shell composed of countless jewels. Obviously, a creature such as this is a prime target for adventurers. However, they are quick to run and can hold their own when backed into a corner, making capture not as simple as it might appear."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_050,"A warhorse from ages long past, reborn into spirit form. While generally disinterested in others, it will defend itself when threatened."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_051,This monster has encased its unstable spirit in a frozen form to maintain its existence. It's said that on rare occasion all sound will disappear from the area where these creatures appear.
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_052,"A reincarnated monster that has taken form using scorching hot lava. It repeatedly appears and disappears along with the glow its body gives off. Able to hover in midair, it favors attacks from above."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_053,"A spirit that has formed a body of wind for itself. With a whinny and a blast of powerful magic, it kicks away anyone who tries to harm it."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_054,"A monster capable of calling forth calamity. Its body is constantly absorbing mana as it wells up from the ground, granting it startlingly strong magical abilities."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_055,A monster that emits a golden glimmer. It appears and disappears as it slowly trots along. Its magnificent appearance captivates anyone who spots it.
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_056,A massive creature that trudges placidly along in areas with water. This carnivorous creature is so large that it is capable of swallowing a human being whole.
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_057,"This creature enjoys deep waters. It's generally content to laze away at the bottom of a body of water, only rising to the surface to feed. Reluctant to leave the water at all, it waits with its mouth open for prey to approach it."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_058,"This variety is the heaviest of its species. While it could be assumed that this extra weight is why it prefers standing still over walking at a sluggish pace, it moves with alarming alacrity when provoked."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_059,"A monster covered in moss and aquatic plants. Its species is known for having impressive jaw strength, but this variety's bite is the most powerful. It approaches prey with its mouth wide open, so that it can swiftly devour them."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_060,"A humanoid monster capable of walking on two feet. It tends to sit among the local flora, blending in perfectly with plants, ores, and other frequently gathered ingredients."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_061,A monster that ambushes its prey by spreading spores. The spores are toxic to human beings when inhaled or touched. These creatures can also release condensed versions of their spores from the top of their heads.
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_062,"A monster with a body as tough as stone. While releasing spores mixed with sand and stones is its defining feature, it is also an efficient magic user. As such, it is generally agreed that it possesses a moderate amount of intelligence."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_063,This monster is created when particular parasitic spores come into contact with a Soilplower. It is the most intelligent variety of its species and is capable of wielding both strong magic and a sturdy staff.
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_092,"A monster with skin as tough as boulders. Extremely territorial, they are constantly on the lookout for any potential intruders."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_093,"A monster that makes its home in forests. Their green scales blend in with the trees, allowing them to easily vanish from sight. They are adept at lying in wait for prey, perfectly camouflaged until they strike."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_094,"This monster's body temperature is so cold that being in close proximity to it is enough to bring on a chill. Their scales are perpetually covered in frost. They are constantly on the move, but whether or not that is to keep themselves from freezing on the spot is unknown."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_095,"A monster with an incredibly high body temperature. Their boulder-like scales are always red-hot and can cause severe burns when touched. They also seem to have a strong sense of camaraderie, choosing to call their fellows when they spot prey instead of hunting solo."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_096,"This monster has the hardest hide among members of its species. When in a pack, these easy-going monsters like to snuggle up and sleep nestled together. Anyone foolish enough to intrude on their rest will soon be racing away from a group of very awake and very annoyed creatures."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_097,"These aggressive monsters have talons and tails that can slice through boulders. While they are often seen leading packs (and are therefore considered to be the highest-ranking subspecies), they prefer to act alone."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_098,"A monster that gently hovers in midair. While they do not seem to possess much in the way of consciousness, they will chase after any living creature that invades what they consider to be their personal space."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_099,"This monster is as slow as other members of its species and quite easy to run from. However, they have evolved a blue color that makes them hard to spot in the sky, so there are several accounts of adventurers accidentally walking into them."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_100,"A purple monster that resembles a flower. In fact, there are many accounts of them being approached because of that resemblance from afar. People are rarely afraid of them, even while being chased, due to their pleasant appearance."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_101,"This monster's bright red color and horns often make people think of red ogres, hence its name. While not as overwhelmingly powerful as its namesake, the sight of one descending from the sky is rather frightening."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_102,"This variety is the most ferocious of its species. Once it has spotted prey, it swoops down from above to attack it. Compared to the others, these jellyfish are considerably more assertive hunters."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_103,"A monster with a beautiful transparent appearance. They stockpile massive amounts of electricity within their bodies, which they will not hesitate to use against those that approach them. They glow in the dark and produce enough light to serve as replacements for lanterns."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_104,"A golem modeled after the human form. In order to conserve what little remains of their mana, these sentinels sit and wait for potential enemies. When one does draw near, they will use the last of their stores to chase it down."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_105,"A golem that was constructed to defend urban areas. While the region has since fallen to ruin, it still dutifully patrols its assigned routes."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_106,"A defensive golem designed specifically for essential facilities. Upon detecting an intruder, it sends out a mana-based signal to other golems in the area, sharing the location of the trespasser."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_107,"A solid golem constructed from metal. Long exposure to the elements has caused it to rust in various places. In order to conserve its mana stores, it only moves between bouts of inactivity."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_108,"These golems act as guardians of the most important establishments. Built to ruthlessly eliminate intruders, their simple design belies their immense power. They are generally on standby while seated to reduce their mana consumption."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_109,"A golem created to be the ultimate weapon. It is said that a single one of these was enough to serve as the main offensive on the battlefields of old. It seems to have an abundance of mana as it is constantly on the move, searching for opponents."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_110,"A monster that lurks in forests. They are incapable of sitting still and can always be found pacing or restlessly looking around. After spotting prey, they use their immense leg strength to close the distance and pounce."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_111,"This monster has characteristically large fangs and a thick pelt. Their packs are usually family units, with young cubs often seen scampering close behind their parents. Although this scene is rather heartwarming, any onlookers will be swiftly pounced upon if discovered."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_112,"This type of monster makes its den in deep woods. It forgoes excessive movement, sitting still as it waits for prey to wander within its range. Needless to say, it is a very accomplished hunter."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_113,This monster lives primarily in wetlands. Groups of them can be seen lazing along the edge of bodies of water. Their fangs are strong enough to pierce steel.
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_114,This creature's luxurious black pelt is its most distinguishing characteristic. This is the fastest of the various subspecies. It uses its formidable speed to ram into its targets with enough force to knock them clean off their feet.
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_115,"A beast with a magnificent silver and white mane. It is an elder within its community and prefers to leisurely patrol its territory. When with a group, it will keep an eye on its surroundings while lounging about. However, it becomes the most ferocious member of its species when faced with a genuine threat."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_126,"A Blue Puni that has grown to a large size. It is thought that this uncommon growth is caused by either diet or genetics, but the exact reasons are not yet known."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_127,"A monster that is as powerful as it is enormous. Most of its body is made of mana, so it is easily affected by its surroundings. While it does not normally move much, if it detects a moving object it will chase after it."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_128,"Named after the bottomless sense of dread it evokes when it is seen. It is not the type to be taken by surprise, so exercise extreme caution when fighting it."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_129,"A monster that prefers places with dense mana concentration. It is extremely hostile and will attack anything that comes near it, damaging its surroundings in the process. It would be wise to stay away when it is rampaging."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_130,"A monster with such a faint presence that it quickly fades from memory. This is quite troublesome for adventurers, as they forget what the monster looks like and its weaknesses."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_131,"A mysterious monster that can change its face into various forms. There have been very few sightings of it, but in most cases it is found isolated from other monsters. It possesses unparalleled physical strength, capable of crushing any object."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_132,"Artificial soldiers created via alchemy that specialize in combat. They will never harm their maker, but are incapable of following complex commands."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_133,"These monsters are more specialized in defense compared to other soldiers. There is a hierarchy among them, with the higher ranks overseeing the lower ones. They often move in groups, so it is important to avoid being surrounded when fighting them."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_134,A soldier that simply obeys its maker. It is extremely loyal and will doggedly follow any order to its completion.
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_135,"These monsters are capable of imitating the fighting styles of past warriors. While this does not extend to the use of advanced swordplay, their basic movements are highly refined. They are constantly training when enemies aren't around."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_136,"Warriors created based on special forces that once served the empire. They act as the emperor's trusted sword and have unparalleled strength, each one capable of defeating a hundred men."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_142,"A monster that has grown to a remarkable size, bringing others under its command as their leader. Becoming a leader requires overcoming incredibly fierce battles, so the fewer scars one has, the stronger it is."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_143,"A monster that is able to use powerful magic after having absorbed mana for a long time. Since it excels at long distance attacks, the best course of action is to attempt to get close."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_144,"A monster that has been called the ruler of the night since ancient times. It has better night vision than others like it, allowing it to attack with precision even in the dark. The attack it performs with the wind generated from its wings is particularly powerful and must be watched out for."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_145,"A monster that holds expansive territory and destroys its surroundings. Since it has grown much larger than the others of its kind, it moves slowly but possesses great destructive force."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_146,"A monster with arms as thick as logs. It needs a lot of food to sustain its sturdy body, so it often goes on rampages out of hunger."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_147,"A monster that carries around a large shell on its back. Because it prefers heavier shells, it can take a blow without as much as a wince. It's important to aim for its vitals in order for attacks to have any effect."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_148,"A monster with a high concentration of mana in its body, making magic attacks almost useless against it. This also allows for it to move with extreme quickness, to the point of appearing to teleport instantaneously."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_149,"A glutton that devours all manner of things, other monsters being no exception. It is a common sight to even see it turning on its friends. Escaping from it is extremely difficult once it catches sight of you, so exercise the utmost caution."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_150,"A monster that constantly discharges electricity. It stores so much electricity that it's impossible for humans to withstand direct contact with it. When this monster is nearby, any hair will be drawn towards it from the static, which is a way to spot its presence early."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_151,"A golem with the authority to bring other golems under its command. It also has the duty of stopping malfunctioning golems, so it has better cognitive abilities than its peers."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_152,"A monster that has lived on its own without the help of the surrounding group. Because of that, it is very cautious and difficult to hit."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_153,"A monster that is constantly lying in wait for prey, preferring places with dirty water. Because of this disposition, it is highly resistant to disease, and its scales are always shiny and polished."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_154,"A monster that is always emitting spores. In a short battle this won't pose an issue, but inhaling spores for an extended period will cause one to feel sick, so it's best to keep any fighting quick."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_155,"A monster that inhabits caves, hanging from the ceiling. It has poor eyesight, but locates its prey by emitting ultrasonic waves. It swoops down to attack once the target draws near."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_156,"A true hunter that prefers dark places and hunts down its prey one after the other. However, it is sensitive to light and freezes up for a time if the sun shines on it."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_157,"A monster that specializes in working as a group, resonating with the others to establish their hunting grounds. Each knows the position of the others at all times, allowing for powerful combination attacks."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_158,"A variety of monster that absorbs mana from its prey as it sucks its blood. It uses stronger magic than its peers, so one must be cautious of it even while at a distance."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_159,"A monster that has taken control of a cave by defeating all of the other monsters within it. It rarely sleeps and is highly observant, noticing even the smallest of irregularities."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_160,"A hostile Geni. They gather metal from their surroundings and decorate themselves with it, using it to strike back when they are attacked by monsters."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_161,"A Geni with a habit of stealing things. They nonchalantly approach monsters and then steal any rare materials they might be holding. Despite that, they aren't particularly strong in a straight fight."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_162,"A Geni that attacks indiscriminately on the front lines. They rarely decide to work in groups, but in such a case it would be wise to flee quickly."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_163,"A Geni warrior. They have sturdy defenses and shoot down enemy attacks with impressive skill. Although dexterous, they lack physical strength, so large weapons can defeat them easily."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_164,"A Geni axe master. Any spare time they have is devoted to sharpening their axe, to the point that even a light touch of the blade will draw blood. It seems that self-inflicted wounds are not uncommon due to this."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_165,"A legendary Geni warrior, of which there are said to be only a few. Well renowned for their strength, it is said even ten ordinary Geni could not win against them."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_166,"A Geni that is craftier than the others and skilled at tracking prey. They will gather up other Geni in the area to fight against foes they cannot defeat alone, making them extremely formidable."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_167,"A hostile Neru. They are great with close combat weapons and fight with gusto, but it's easy to anticipate their attacks."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_168,"A Neru that excels at using mana. Highly intelligent, they aim their attacks with precision. However, they lack physical strength, making them more susceptible to incoming fire."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_169,"A Neru that is more knowledgeable than the others, always studying. The longer their lifespan, the more expansive their knowledge, meaning even keener attacks."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_170,"Neru with the power to heal those around them. Such an ability is quite rare, so there aren't many of them. They need to concentrate to use healing magic, so they do not utilize it during battle."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_171,"Neru that are more ill-natured than the others. They are adept at targeting their enemies' weak points, so when attacked by them be sure to protect your vital areas while escaping."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_172,"Among the Neru warriors, this individual holds the position of captain. Since they are good at commanding others to fight, it is effective to prioritize them first if you cross paths in battle."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_173,"One of the rare leaders among the Neru. Although they almost never participate in battle, when they do their power is great enough to change the tide of the fight."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_174,A monster with a strong body and large wings. His intense aura makes even other monsters shrink back. He is the cause of the disaster that Viktor and Isla witnessed in the Duerer domain.
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_175,"A special kind of monster called a mutant. There is deep rage within her eyes. Once a normal human, she was modified by alchemy and has been shackled by it ever since."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_176,"A mutant who always appears in unexpected places. He has an abundant knowledge of alchemy and keeps Yumia and the others in check at every turn. Even now his true intentions remain elusive, only his twisted madness leaving a clear impression."
STR_LIBRARY_MONSTER_177,"A phantom of the past, or perhaps a curse that has been carved into history. The long-lived grudge of the Aladissian Empire has been lurking in the forbidden land for centuries, plotting his return."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_000,Regular water that can be gathered from anywhere. Quench your thirst or use it as an ingredient for alchemy. It's pure and clean.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_001,"Water gathered from an underground lake. Its chemical composition is similar to that of regular water, but it stays colder at room temperature. Perfect for a hot day or after working up a sweat."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_002,"Water that has grown salty from exposure to strong sunlight. It's buoyant enough that branches float to the top. It can be used as an alchemy ingredient, but it's probably best not to drink it."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_003,"Water imbued with minerals from the earth over a long period of time. Its nutrient profile makes it perfect for drinking or cooking. But don't drink too much, or it might upset your stomach."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_004,"Water that contains many impurities. To put it frankly, this water is absolutely filthy. It might make a useful ingredient for alchemy, but for your own safety, please don't drink it."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_005,"Water absorbed from the ground and collected inside bamboo. The water itself is sweet, but the pink nutrient-filled deposits floating around in it are slightly bitter, so the flavor isn't for everyone."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_006,"Carbonated water mixed with metallic compounds. Has turned black from the metal inside degrading slowly over time. The strong metallic smell keeps anyone from drinking it, even by accident."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_007,"A floating liquid formed into the shape of a ring. The phenomenon that allows it to float in midair and the reason it is shaped like a ring are, of course, unknown."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_008,"Precious water containing compounds from ancient times long before the old ages. It is difficult to warm up, perhaps due to those compounds, leading to it being said to be impossible to bring to a boil."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_009,"Water that is said to be imbued with spiritual power. It appears colorless and transparent at first glance, but changes colors depending on how the light hits it."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_010,"A weed that can be seen growing everywhere. It actually harbors an infinitesimal amount of mana in its leaves, but it's in such scant quantities that even Welleks have difficulties detecting it."

STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_012,"Grass that produces a white, fluffy substance after flowering. A single plant doesn't produce much, but the fluff is highly valued as a component used in making string, cloth, and even bedding."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_013,"A plant with rotating petals. Some think the plant rotates to better catch the wind and weather storms, but no one knows for sure. It's often used to check how strong the wind is blowing, and in which direction."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_014,"This plant's most memorable characteristic is its hard to describe shape. In fact, that's its only memorable characteristic. That's what eventually led to people calling it a Whatchamacallit."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_015,This plant's reddish tinge makes it an ideal visual marker for people traveling through forests. It gets its name from its resemblance to a bird of paradise spreading its wings.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_016,"An incredibly sturdy vine. It can be pulled on without snapping, and it can even support the weight of multiple adults."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_017,"A plant with hard, spiky leaves. It secretes a flammable goo that's highly valued as a fuel. It's easy to hurt your hands on this plant's spikes, so gathering it requires a knife or other tool."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_018,"A grass with fruits that resemble paper lanterns. Although the fruits emit a red glow, there isn't a light inside of them, but rather the glow comes from the fruits themselves."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_019,"A wild grass with four leaves. These clovers most commonly only grow three leaves, so those with more are said to be a source of luck. Just finding one makes one feel lucky."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_020,"A clover that one might find growing anywhere, with one difference—soil quality has turned its flower blue. But besides that, it's just an average clover."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_021,"A plant with red, black, and purple leaves. Its vivid colors resemble a jester's outfit and make it stand out, so it is easy to spot in the wild."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_022,"A type of cactus believed to have gone extinct long ago. Unlike other cacti, this cactus grows entirely at right angles, hence its name."

STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_024,"The same species of tree as the grand trees which are thousands of years old. Only a few saplings remain in Eustella, which makes this quite rare. It's a good idea to use this for something important."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_025,"The leaf of a rainbow-colored plant. The order of the colors seems to change depending on the angle one looks at it, but exactly seven colors are always visible. It has an iridescent glow in the dark."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_026,"A plant with translucent blue leaves that store large quantities of water. Just touching them is like dunking your hand in water. You can suck moisture from the leaves, but it doesn't taste very good."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_027,"A leaf with a shape and color reminiscent of an angel's wings. When the wind blows, the leaf flutters into the air like real wings, but gently floats back into your hands once the wind settles."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_028,"A wildflower that grows several layers of leaves. The inside of the plant doesn't get wet when it rains, so small insects often make it their home. People who don't like bugs should stay away."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_029,"A cute pink flower with small petals that form orb-like clusters. Care must be taken when harvesting them, or else they will quickly fall apart in one's hands."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_030,"The spiky fruit of a plant. Take a stroll in any forest and you'll find plenty on the ground. It's often used as a throwing weapon, but the flesh is also quite tasty if you crack it open."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_031,A strange Uni that has not been tampered with—the smoke is a natural effect. The warm and steamy insides have a rich sweetness to them that makes it a popular snack.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_032,"An Uni that has morphed into steel due to having grown in soil rich in metallic nutrients. Splitting one is no easy task, and even if you did, eating the insides is ill-advised as they contain hazardous levels of iron."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_033,"A type of Uni which, by virtue of its many, many years of existence, has largely crystallized. While the non-crystallized parts can be consumed, they don't taste very good."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_034,A flower used as an ingredient in medicine. It's very common and can be found growing on the side of roads. Most people with a garden treat this plant like a weed.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_035,"A blue flower found throughout Aladiss. It grows everywhere, but it is poisonous and needs to be handled carefully. It's not deadly unless consumed in large doses, but touching it can give you a rash."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_036,"A yellow flower found throughout Aladiss. It's not used in any medicines, and it isn't poisonous. It doesn't have any special characteristics at all. This is just a completely ordinary flower."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_037,"Despite looking like it was carved from ice, this carnation is a regular flower. It's not cold to the touch, and it won't melt. But using it as a decoration does make a room feel colder."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_038,"An eye-catching flower with a brilliant red hue. Legend has it that the spirits of the deceased create outfits using its petals. As a result, it is not uncommon to see clothing pieces inspired by this particular plant."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_039,A flower with a peculiar name. No guides exist that explain the name's origin. Why was this ordinary flower given such a name? Will the world ever know?
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_040,"A flower imprisoned in branches that grow around it like a cage. The yellowish-green tips of the red flowers emit a sweet scent that attracts insects, which then are trapped inside and digested for nutrients."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_041,"This flower's pattern reflects how the sky looked the moment it bloomed. Most bloom during the day and turn blue, but some rare ones look like falling snow or the starry sky and fetch a high price."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_042,"A beautiful and vibrant flower named for its resemblance to the sun. Its ideal habitat and growth conditions are unknown, and it withers quickly when gathered for cultivation."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_043,"A white flower that seems plain during the day, but sparkles when exposed to moonlight. Its beauty attracts people and animals alike, and many creatures make their home in areas where it blooms."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_044,"A flower enclosed in a cage of metal branches. While the bloom inside would be worth a bundle, removing it from its enclosure is nigh impossible. For the flower's sake, please admire it in its current state."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_045,"A type of hibiscus that blooms around mining areas. The iridescent, metallic quality of the petals is similar to bismuth crystals. As a material, it gets used as both a plant and as a metal."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_046,"An astonishingly black carnation. While there's no harm in touching it, staring at its pitch-black petals makes you feel like you're being sucked into it and causes dizziness."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_047,"An ornament of a vivid rose encased in resin. These used to be trendy gifts to give to women. But over time, a great many women received a few too many and ran out of places to put them."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_048,"A flower with crescent-shaped petals. It gets its name from its jade-like translucent coloring and is also called a ""Jeweled Bloom."" While not worth nearly as much as its namesake, it remains a popular plant."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_049,A plant found throughout the world that's been used since ancient times as an ingredient in medicine. There are many folk remedies that use Taun which can be made at home.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_050,"A type of moss that has medicinal compounds, often found growing on rocks near water. It's practically ready-made medicine—it just needs to be crushed and boiled."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_051,"A taller-than-average Taun. Its larger stature means it contains more medicinal compounds. It's less common than regular Taun, so it's a good idea to gather some if you come across it."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_052,"Tree fruits that are so packed with nutrients, it's said one mouthful can heal a sore throat. They got their name from the fact that birds love their taste. Their sweetness makes them difficult to swallow unless diluted in water."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_053,Extremely sweet liquid oozed by a plant that evolved alongside pollinating insects. The liquid has a sugar content so high that eating even small amounts can have you gasping for air. It's far too sweet to eat.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_054,"A plant valued as an ingredient for use in medicine. Its fruits contain seeds that are packed with medicinal compounds, but flowering diminishes their efficacy, so the seeds need to be picked early."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_055,"Intensely fragrant dried flowers. They hardly smell like anything until they're dried. However, if they're left to wither, they give off a very pungent odor. It's best to dry them before that happens."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_056,"Moss rich in calcium that was genetically engineered in the old ages to be used as an ingredient for medicine. Its white surface gathers dirt easily, but a quick rinse is enough to clean it off."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_057,"An effective cure for sickness and injury. Despite being more potent than any medicine provided by a clinic, it's so bitter that even the most stalwart adult struggles to get it down. Any attempts to make the sap easier to drink only make it taste even worse."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_058,A medicinal herb touted as a cure-all for a variety of illnesses and injuries. Its multifaceted leaves and flowers are a reminder of just how many plants were crossbred to make it.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_059,Fertile mushroom spores that thrive in damp environments. There have even been cases of them growing inside other organisms. Accidentally breathing this in could be a catastrophe.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_060,"A plant with roots that resemble a person. When pulled out of the ground, it emits a horrible sound akin to screeching. It hurts to listen to up close, but not enough to cause an ear injury."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_061,A fragrant chunk of wood. People used it in the past as a substitute for perfume until the aromatic compounds were found to be poisonous. This discovery caused a mass panic at the time.

STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_067,"Liquid metal that's inversely affected by gravity. It was eventually found to be inversely affected by other factors as well. For example, heat hardens the liquid and cold makes it melt."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_068,"Ancient vegetation that has been encased in crystal. These plants possess a miraculous life force and are still alive within the crystal, despite the absence of air and water."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_069,"Silvery liquid nestled in a chalice. Said to have been created by an alchemist, this fluid is brimming with mysterious power. While it supposedly grants beneficial properties to whatever it's being used to make, it's also incredibly difficult to handle."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_070,"A potent medicinal flower capable of bringing someone back from the brink of death. Because the flower must first be processed using alchemy, most people aren't aware of its use as a medicine."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_071,Sparkling white sand that's often used in pottery. Finer sand sells for a higher price.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_072,"Black sand with grains that are almost as small as atoms. It can stain your hands and clothes black, so it's best to keep it away from any white clothing. Often used to make ink."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_073,"Emerald-colored sand. A closer look reveals the grains are made up of small, glassy rock particles. It's most commonly found among other ores and rarely ever found on its own."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_074,The various metallic fragments mixed into the sand are what give this ingredient its uniquely shifting colors. Handling it can make your hands prickle.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_075,"Fine iron powder similar to sand. Though it's commonly mistaken for iron sand, it's composed entirely of crushed iron. No one knows how it gets turned into such a fine powder."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_076,"Shimmering particles said to have rained down from the sky during a meteor shower. A number of unknown minerals are mixed in, so they are widely believed to have come from beyond the stars."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_077,"Broken-off pieces of stone. To put it simply, they're just rocks. Go for a stroll and you'll probably trip over dozens of these. They're practically worthless."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_078,"A stone that's been enveloped in moss. These are pretty easy to find near areas with water, such as beaches and riverbanks."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_079,"A mysterious stone with a pale glow. There are many tales about the stone, like how it has spiritual power, or that it came from a meteorite. But the only thing anyone knows for sure is that it glows."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_080,"The fossil of a creature that inhabited the region long ago. It's common to find fossils of undiscovered creatures, but since they contain many precious elements, most aren't turned in for research."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_081,"A mysterious ore containing the power of air. When smashed open, it releases all of the air energy contained within. Caution is needed when smashing larger ones to avoid getting blown away."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_082,"A craggy gray stone made from a mixture of sand and ash. It's coarse, and simply running your finger along the surface is enough to scrape some off, but it's highly impact-resistant."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_083,"A stone craft made by people in ancient times. It's believed these were used in contests of wit, and anyone able to separate the pieces earned the respect of their peers. It's very fragile, so it must be handled with care."

STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_085,"A piece from a set of armor once worn by a monster. It is too large and heavy for humans to use and is splattered with bloodstains from countless battles, which no amount of scrubbing will remove."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_086,"A stone speckled with cobalt, though the scant amount contained within means that this shimmering stone is generally treated like any other rock. Occasionally, it is refined and used in pigment creation."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_087,"A rock shaped like a knight's shield. While it's meant to serve as a wall decoration, it seems like it could be taken down and used as an actual shield during times of trouble. It has the strength of metal despite being stone."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_088,A stone compressed and hardened over the ages by deep ocean pressure. Cracks in the stone reveal a blue color reminiscent of the sea that forged it.

STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_090,Ore that converts ambient heat into cool air. It feels cold to the touch because it turns body heat into cold air. Prolonged exposure can lead to hypothermia. It's great for keeping ingredients fresh.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_091,"The most commonly known ore. Wherever there's ore to be gathered, you're likely to find amatite ore."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_092,"A milky-white, transparent ore. It's incredibly hard, which makes it difficult to gather by hand. By polishing the surface until it glitters, you can sell it as a valuable jewel."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_093,"Incredibly heavy ore that is commonly used for making armor. It might be tough to move around in, but regular attacks just bounce right off."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_094,"A deep-blue ore with white patterns made from densely concentrated carbon. It's used to make swords, spears, and other weapons, but is also commonly used to make kitchen knives and other bladed tools."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_095,"This looks like plain, black ore, but each chunk reveals a different color when cracked open. Bets and divinations are made regarding the color found inside. Despite the color difference, their chemical composition is the same."

STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_098,"Four-colored ore. Each color contains the power of its respective element—fire, ice, bolt, and air. This makes it a versatile alchemical ingredient, but it's not very useful as a building material."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_099,A beautiful blue gem-like crystal. It is incredibly hard and requires specialized techniques to process due to the considerable amount of mana that it siphons from the ground and stores.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_100,Relatively easy to find shards of crystal. Very commonly found in rocky areas or near cliffs.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_101,A chunk of crystallized amber. These are often found with ancient insects or plants preserved inside. Pieces that contain rare creatures are sold for higher prices than translucent ones.

STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_103,A vibrant green crystal entwined in ivy. Its appearance has led people to believe that it's inhabited by the spirits of plants. Carrying one is said to have a calming effect on its owner.

STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_105,"A round, cracked gemstone. It contains the power of the bolt element and emits an electrical discharge that resembles a halo."

STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_107,"This coral absorbs metals in the water and forms a metallic plating that acts like armor to protect it from predators. It's not only sturdy, but also very sharp. It can cut your hands if you're not careful."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_108,A fossilized Puni. Why would a creature with no bones and no shell leave behind a fossil? No one knows. It's one of the great mysteries of the world.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_109,"Crystal fragments with swirling flame-like power hidden within. They feel a little hot to the touch, but if someone wanted to unleash their true power, they would have to reconstruct a full crystal."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_110,"An unusual stone made of more than one mineral. The purple portions are an ore rich in magical power, while the yellow segments are glassy gemstones that become jewels once polished."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_111,"A remarkably hard gemstone. Although there is rare ore clearly contained within it, extracting it is a difficult endeavor due to the aforementioned hardness. Even brute force wouldn't put so much as a dent into it."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_112,"Finely ground wood chips made from a dried chunk of wood. It is mainly used to help light fires, but can also be spread in the air to create a dust explosion."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_113,"This plant's seedpods explode to send their seeds over long distances. The seeds make quite the impact after they ""pop,"" and getting hit by them can cause serious injuries."

STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_115,Metal that's been crushed into a powder. The mixture of various metals causes a chemical reaction that emits an electrical discharge.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_116,"An extremely hot liquid that closely resembles lava. It is constantly in motion, and every so often an air bubble will burst into sparks. The glass jar that holds it is also impressive, though it's really only useful as a container."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_117,"They're exactly what they look like—scraps of paper. Maybe they used to be an important document, or a note, or something else entirely. Whatever they were, they're junk now. Useful as a source of fuel for fire."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_118,An organ that some say was the heart of an ancient creature. It's still beating vigorously thanks to the fungus that has taken it over.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_119,"An ever-burning orange flame. It may look like a ball of fire, but a closer look reveals there's a small chunk of burning ore in the center. The extreme heat it emits makes it hard to gather and store."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_120,"An easy-to-carry battery. Though initially passed off as, ""The only battery someone would ever need,"" most people agree it's a disappointing battery. It's useful as an alchemical ingredient, though."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_121,"As the name suggests, this is meat taken from a beast. Blood draining and other preparations are already complete, so it's ready to heat and eat!"
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_122,"An egg from some wild creature. Whether it's from an animal or a monster is as enigmatic as why these eggs seem to be everywhere. They're also unfertilized, so this is likely an unsolvable mystery."

STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_124,"A sour fruit with a very sweet finish. It takes some courage to bite into, but after braving the intense sour flavor, sweet, nutritious juices overwhelm your taste buds. It's a popular health food."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_125,"A soft, juicy fruit. How it tastes depends on when it was picked. It's refreshingly sweet if picked at night, but bitter and watery if picked during the day. Best to avoid picking it during the day."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_126,"A translucent, honey-colored fruit that contains an absurd amount of syrupy liquid. Once it's created enough syrup, it breaks open to attract insects that spread its seeds."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_127,"A fruit so devilishly spicy that only the most hardened spice-lover can tolerate it. To most people, it's a hazardous material more than it is a food. Never rub your eyes after handling one!"
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_128,"A plant that produces two different colors of fruit. The red ones are sweet but hard, and the green ones are soft but sour. It's common to eat both at the same time, but some prefer one over the other."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_129,"A fruit so sweet it mesmerizes all who eat it, including animals. This makes it hard for humans to find anything but scraps of this fruit. Finding one fully intact and ready to eat is incredibly rare."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_130,"A fruit bursting with juice. The flavor isn't for everyone, but it's full of iron, making it perfect for people with iron deficiencies. Just be careful not to ingest too much, or you'll get sick."

STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_133,"A type of garlic that has grown long like an elderly man's beard over many years. While the bulbous parts pack a strong spicy punch, the slender portions are sweet and delicious. The one drawback is that it smells awful."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_134,"It might not look appetizing, but this fungus is perfectly edible. While it isn't poisonous or otherwise harmful, it does function as a kind of truth serum. Carelessly snacking on one may lead to unintended consequences."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_135,"A fruit with leaves that make it look like it's flying. Its unique appearance has popularized it as a sort of good luck charm, so it is often given as a celebratory present."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_136,"A large beehive that's packed with honey and bee larvae. Some people might look at it and see a delicious meal, but to an alchemist, it's yet another precious material with countless uses."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_137,This beehive can only be found deep in the forest. It's camouflaged with moss to blend into the foliage and protect the hive from beasts and monsters sniffing around for the honey inside.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_138,"A beehive brimming with shockingly pink honey. Although it's chock-full of nutrients, the almost unbearable bitterness of the honey hasn't won it too many fans."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_139,"A silver beehive full of sweet honey. While the metallic hue might be off-putting, it's made from flowers and can be eaten without problem. In fact, the quality is higher than normal honey, making it worth more."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_140,"A three-tiered beehive. Unlike regular hives, this one's sole purpose is to collect a ton of honey. The honey kept in the center section is the sweetest and most nutritious."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_141,"A mushroom used in a wide variety of dishes. Since they go well with everything, they're great to throw in a dish when you lack other ingredients. Freshly picked ones can be eaten raw."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_142,"A mushroom with a cap as big as an umbrella. The cap looks like a woven hat, earning it the nickname ""Fairy Cap."" This mushroom does have a stem, but it's so small that it's hard to notice it."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_143,"A gray mushroom notable for how much its cap resembles roof tiles. Despite how it looks, it's actually pretty tasty. However, it does need to be cooked for a long time to remove its astringency."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_144,"A perpetually wilted mushroom. It never feels fresh, even moments after being picked, and it just plain doesn't taste good. There's really no reason to try eating this one."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_145,"As its name suggests, this is one dangerous mushroom. That's not to say it's poisonous—its ability to multiply is the problem. If you spot one somewhere, it can cover the entire area within ten days."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_146,A mushroom with a deep-blue cap that has countless white flecks. It earned its name due to its resemblance to the evening sky.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_147,"A mushroom with a sword-like cap. It might have grown in metal-rich soil and developed the sword as a defense against predators, but no one knows for sure. It's just one of those natural mysteries."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_148,"A mushroom that developed black spots, possibly due to growing near a mine. People say that fairies use them to take shelter from the rain."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_149,"A mushroom that contains crystallized spores in its cap. It's not edible, of course, but the beautiful crystals it grows are processed and turned into jewelry."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_150,"A mushroom whose cap is adorned with something that very much resembles a tiny crown. It is also called a ""Mushroom King."" Popular for its rich flavor, its scarcity makes it a valuable item."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_151,A shell commonly found on beaches. It's quite beautiful and in good enough shape to be used for accessories. It can also be used as an ingredient for alchemy.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_152,"A freshwater fish that's found in rivers and lakes all over the world. It's unclear if they're just naturally curious, but you don't even need to bait the hook for them to give it a nibble."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_153,"A crawfish with a hard shell and big claws. They're even found in drainage ditches, and kids love to catch them. They can be boiled and eaten, but they might smell bad depending on where they were caught."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_154,"This fish uses its wing-like fins to jump out of the water with so much force that it looks like it's gliding across the water's surface. Apparently, they rarely swim the normal way."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_155,A fish that lives in rivers with abundant greenery. It covers itself in moss while it swims to avoid predators. The moss forms roots under its scales which need to be removed before cooking the fish.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_156,"Despite being named after mossy balls of algae, this seaweed is actually a relative of Uni. No one knows exactly how this spiky seaweed was given such a cute name."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_157,"A fish said to make its home in areas people never visit. The color of its fins makes it resemble a monk's robes, which has led to some people thinking of it as a holy fish."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_158,"A fish with fins resembling a steel trap. It's believed to have evolved this way to help capture its prey. The fins can also be used offensively, which in rare cases has led to people getting injured."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_159,"A fish with toxic spines. It retracts them while swimming around, but inflates its body and extends the spines to protect itself when threatened by predators."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_160,"A sea snail with a body and shell that look as though they're rotten and melting. They seem to lead normal lives, all things considered, so it's tough to tell if they're actually rotting or not."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_161,"A massive fish with a sharp, spiny upper jaw. They are relatively easy to catch, but there have been numerous reports of Sawe Fish going wild and attacking the people who caught them."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_162,"A fish that camouflages itself as a rock. Its skin is thick enough to withstand explosions, and it has sharp spines it tackles foes with. Despite all that, its flesh is said to be tender and delicious."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_163,"A large fish with a head like a hammer. The bones in its head are as hard as iron, so anything it attacks is bound to get injured. For how ferocious and hard it is to catch, it isn't very tasty."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_164,"A fish protected by a copper shell. It's not particularly aggressive—in fact, it's quite friendly—but because its fins are as sharp as blades, it can end up cutting things that get near it."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_165,A crab capable of generating electricity inside its body. It grabs its prey with its pincers and delivers an electric shock so strong it can even knock out a person. It's best to stay away from them.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_166,"A mollusk with a shell thick enough to withstand explosions. Molten metals from mines helped it form a shell so hard that it came to be named after the legendary metal, orichalcum."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_167,"Named not for its resemblance to flying lizards, but to the color of the similarly-named fruit. Some expect it to be fierce like a dragon, but it's quite docile and spends its days leisurely swimming."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_168,"A fish that seems to flutter through the water. While its fairy-like appearance has most fall in love with it at first sight, anyone who bears witness to its atrocious eating habits never sees it as adorable ever again."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_169,"A mythical fish said to have gone extinct. While only display specimens exist in Eustella, they still inhabit Aladiss. Despite being an endangered species, they are said to be delicious whether steamed, roasted, or raw."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_170,A fish with a large horn protruding from its head. It evolved this barbed horn for hunting and uses it to attack not only other fish but also to spear birds out of the sky.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_171,This bee doesn't collect nectar but instead feeds on the flowers themselves. They use the colors of their bodies to mimic leaves and—before you know it—they've devoured all the flowers in sight.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_172,"An ant with a body full of sweet nectar. These ants try to bring as much as possible back to their nests, so they stuff themselves until they're almost bursting. Kids in Eustella often eat them as a snack."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_173,"A bug that hates the light. It lives in places where light can't reach, like at the bottom of lakes or deep inside ruins. These bugs are docile and don't run when touched, which makes them easy to capture."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_174,"A bug that looks like it's carrying a mushroom on its back. They bury their bodies when they sleep, leading people to mistakenly pick them. The mushroom is actually part of the bug, so forget eating it."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_175,"A bug with large scissors. The scissors are sharp enough to cut through not only plants and nuts, but also other insects this bug preys on. It's a good idea to wear gloves while handling one."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_176,"A butterfly with dark red wings that flies gracefully through the air, spreading dust so fine that it is invisible to the naked eye. The dust is toxic, but its effects are too weak to affect people."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_177,"A bug with magnetic horns. The magnetic force of the horns is strong enough that it often gets stuck to metal and can't pull away. Despite its two horns, it's a subspecies of rhinoceros beetle."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_178,"A bug that seems to have seven differently colored spots. Looking at one up close reveals these spots are actually jewels. No one knows why this bug grows jewels, but it's likely it was artificially created."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_179,"An insect covered in downy fluff. When these bugs take to the sky, they look like large snowflakes fluttering about due to their size. Although they are easy to spot on a sunny day, snowy weather makes them almost impossible to find."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_180,This spider's silk is stronger than iron wire. It can't be torn by hand and is tough to cut even when using a knife. Heating the silk makes it easier to cut and process.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_181,"Viscous thread commonly found in the Sea of Decay. It looks a bit like a spider web, but it's made from sap and plant fiber. It's very strong and can only be cut with a very sharp knife."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_182,"Copper wire that generates heat when mana flows through it. Indoor heaters which use this as a component are quite popular. This effect can also be achieved with electricity, but little is known about it."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_183,Hugely absorbent spider silk. Any rain that touches these threads is immediately absorbed and subsequently released on sunny days.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_184,"A tree commonly used for construction. Lumber from this tree is as hard as metal, making it very difficult to work with. Despite that, it's well-loved by people who want to build sturdy wooden structures."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_185,"As its name implies, this is a very sturdy log. The tree it came from is so hard that it's difficult to chop down. Many craftspeople swear that processing this wood is harder than building a house."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_186,A piece of a very old tree that withered over countless years. It's hardened so much that it's easily mistaken for stone.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_187,"This plant grows its branches in random directions every day. There's no regularity to how branches grow, so they slowly become limp and sag. They never seem to twist into knots for some reason."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_188,"A chunk of wood infested with fungi. The mushrooms on it grow at an incredible speed, which is why it's more often used for mushroom cultivation than as lumber."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_189,"This tree was felled by a powerful electric current and became strongly magnetized. It repels nearby pebbles and sand that contain iron, making them float."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_190,"A tree full of bolt energy. People believe them to be trees that are still left standing after being struck by lightning, but no one has ever seen it happen. It's more of an urban legend."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_191,A light pink chunk of lumber in the shape of a heart. Word has it that a number of scholars are investigating whether it was artificially made or if it grows this way naturally.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_192,Sturdy lumber that has existed for a thousand years. Its surface has become covered with moss and ivy over the many months and years. The reason this tree does not rot is that its roots absorb mana in addition to water.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_193,Noxious gas collected from the emissions of rotting wood. The fumes are very toxic and can render a person unable to move for days if inhaled.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_194,"A fluffy, glittering bubble composed of incredibly tiny particles of metal. The metal particles are so small that it might be more accurate to call this a gas rather than a metal."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_195,"An extremely small tornado. While it can't do anything against people or buildings, it is adept at sucking up dirt, dust, and fallen leaves. The occasional bolt of lightning can be seen when peering into the center."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_196,"A chunk of highly transparent purple crystal, believed to hold a mysterious power. It's commonly processed to use in accessories, but can also be used as is to decorate a home."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_197,"A large chunk from an even larger diamond. It is one of the strongest substances, even among metals. Forging it into weapons or armor results in tremendously durable products, but more often these are refined into gemstones and exchanged."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_198,"Rare star-shaped bronze that can be gathered in mines. Based on its shape, it must have been human-made, but then why are there so many found in mines? Is this a prank? Or is it another natural mystery?"
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_199,"Crystal fragments that contain an unusual power. The light inside them shifts in a myriad of patterns, changing the crystals' color on a periodic basis."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_200,"A bug that adores glistening crystals. It places the ones it takes a liking to on its back, carrying them around as its personal treasures. Gathering these creatures is easy, though somewhat guilt-inducing."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_201,"A piece of a shooting star that fell from the sky one day. The star was broken into pieces in order to research the mysterious power that it's understood to contain, but in the end the truth behind that power remains a mystery."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_202,"An informative text from a distant era. Did someone from the past civilization draft it, or is it even older than that? Is it a scribbled memo, or a key document? Nothing is known about it."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_203,"A bone from a giant creature. It's unclear whether this came from an animal or a monster, but whatever it was, it was many times bigger than a person. It's hard enough to be used as a weapon."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_204,"A wild animal pelt. It retains heat and repels water, so clothing made from it fetches a high price. Since pelts like this come from wild animals, it's tough to find large ones in good condition."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_205,"A pelt from a mythical creature. The fur is thicker and much softer than that of regular wild animals, and it is lighter and warmer, too."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_206,Tears shed by a salamander under certain conditions that contain the dragon's power. Even a small amount of this liquid can be used to make either a wonderful medicine or a terrible poison.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_207,"A feather from a salamander. Light enough to be sent soaring by even the slightest breeze, the power imbued in it keeps it in perfect condition, free from any blemishes."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_208,"Sharp talons from an owl monster. Despite being separated from their owner, the nerves are still active. Carelessly touching them can result in injury from the claws suddenly moving."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_209,"An eyeball from a nocturnal monster. It remains sensitive to light even without a body, with its pupil widening and contracting accordingly."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_210,"Fruit from a palma tree, a tree hidden in an area only animals can find. Its shell is hard and the flesh of the fruit isn't tasty at all, but the juice inside is delightfully sweet."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_211,"An armor shard from a set that had once seen many battles. Riddled with nicks or scratches, it would be easy to assume this was simple scrap metal. However, it carries a substantial grudge within."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_212,"A fragment from a monster's burdensome abode. In addition to being incredibly sturdy, traces of maintenance from its previous owner remain. It would appear that it was lovingly crafted."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_213,"The soul of a type of horse that once roamed this land. Even in death, the souls of these horses continue to gallop across the fields. Alchemists have always used them as ingredients for synthesis."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_214,"Scales from the rugged body of a rock raptor. They look like rocks, they feel like rocks, and are virtually identical to a regular pebble. Aside from their less natural color, they have no other distinguishing marks."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_215,"A gelatinous part harvested from a monster. It's flexible enough to be battered, beaten, and sat upon without breaking. While it may look good enough to eat, it doesn't taste like much."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_216,"A jewel found inside a golem that stores the large amount of energy it takes to move its large stone body. Every movement consumes power, and once it runs out, the golem stops dead in its tracks."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_217,A jewel found inside golems. It contains more energy than regular golem cores and can even generate its own energy. Golems with these types of cores can live forever unless they're destroyed.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_218,"Sharp claws from a wild animal. Instead of ripping things apart like regular animal claws, these ones are sharp enough to cut like the blade of a knife."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_219,"An egg laid by a massive, ominous bird. Their hard, black shells often lead to these eggs being mistaken for rocks. They're so packed with nutrients that eating an entire egg would make a person sick."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_220,"The core of a crystal monster. The power emitted by it drew crystals towards said monster to be used for offense, not defense. However, it seems to have lost that ability."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_221,"A scale from a massive monster that lives by water. Color from algae and other aquatic plants has seeped into it, making it impossible to tell what its original shade used to be. It's both extremely flexible and incredibly strong."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_222,"A chunk of iron mixed inside of a fossil. The hard iron makes it difficult to crack open to check what's inside, and yet striking it with too much force will smash it to pieces."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_223,"Coral so old that it has fossilized. While it might have been beautiful back in its day, only vague hints of the previous color remain in the rock."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_228,A strange blue ball gathered from inside a Blue Puni. It's as squishy as a Puni and is a bit cold to the touch. Throwing it makes it bounce really high.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_229,A strange green ball gathered from inside a Green Puni. It's as squishy as a Puni and is a bit cold to the touch. Throwing it makes it bounce really high.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_230,A strange red ball gathered from inside a Red Puni. It's as squishy as a Puni and is a bit cold to the touch. Throwing it makes it bounce really high.

STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_232,A strange black ball gathered from inside a Black Puni. It's as squishy as a Puni and is a bit cold to the touch. Throwing it makes it bounce really high.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_233,A strange white ball gathered from inside a White Puni. It's as squishy as a Puni and is a bit cold to the touch. Throwing it makes it bounce really high.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_234,A strange silver ball gathered from inside a Silver Puni. It's as squishy as a Puni and is a bit cold to the touch. Throwing it makes it bounce really high.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_235,A strange gold ball gathered from inside a Gold Puni. It's as squishy as a Puni and is a bit cold to the touch. Throwing it makes it bounce really high.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_236,A sword enveloped in flames. This particular blaze is designed to slice and burn everything aside from the wielder and their allies.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_237,"A massive ice hammer swirling with cold air. Though it is made of ice, this particular kind doesn't melt in fire or heat."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_238,"A halberd wrapped in lightning. It can shoot lightning at not only those it touches, but also distant targets as well."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_239,"A whirling blade surrounded by the winds. It can be held and used for close-range attacks, or thrown for effective assaults on distant enemies."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_240,"An explosive wreathed in a noxious purple aura. When detonated, it unleashes a dangerous force that has adverse effects on the body."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_241,"A double-ended blade clad in light. While it may look unassuming, the blades contain the power of fire, burning targets on contact."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_242,A sword that floats in the air. It is capable of cloning itself to attack enemies in accordance with its wielder's movements.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_243,An enhanced version of a Flamme. The raging flames enveloping the sword are hot enough to reduce whatever they touch to cinders.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_244,"An enhanced version of a Lehrune. The intense cold air surrounding the icy hammer freezes anything that enters its atmosphere, shattering even steel."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_245,"An enhanced version of a Plajig. The lightning dancing along the halberd crackles in anticipation, landing powerful bolt-like attacks on targets."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_246,"An enhanced version of a Luft. The gale that encircles the whirling blade has all the force of a tornado, and a simple swing sends out sharp air blades that mercilessly mangle enemies."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_247,"A longbow with arrows made to match. Distant targets get shot through, while those closer at hand get a much clearer look at the razor-sharp arrowheads, which can be wielded like knives."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_248,An enhanced version of a Meteor. The double-ended blade flickers with both fire and lightning. Those who master its use are able to wield both elemental powers without so much as blinking.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_249,"A grimoire with immense wind power trapped within its pages. Opening the cover unleashes its full force, but it's so strong that gales of wind can be seen circling the book even while it's still closed."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_250,"A large sword wrapped in rainbow light. Imbued with every sort of power imaginable, there isn't a soul who could hope to survive a strike from this blade."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_251,A remedy made from extracts drawn from plants with medicinal effects. Its nectar-sweet scent calls butterflies directly to the bottle.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_252,"A wooden harp decorated with colorful plants. The sound it makes is like a bird's song, and it's said to be able to cure illnesses. There are many confirmed cases of it actually curing people."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_253,A lovely bouquet with a green and white theme. It's believed to be imbued with spiritual powers that can heal any wound. Some children say they can see fairies floating around these bouquets.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_254,"As you might expect, this bottle contains incredibly bitter medicine. But as the saying goes, ""It tastes awful, but it works."" Drinking it heals injuries in an instant, but few can take it willingly."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_255,A sunny paper doll said to chase away all things bad and evil. People believe that illnesses and evil spirits are expelled the moment this doll is hung in a room. But it has no effect on bad weather.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_256,A crystal ball that projects an image of a field of flowers beneath a blue sky. Looking into it heals all wounds. People believe this item was a blessing gifted to soldiers from a divine source.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_257,"A magical umbrella used to summon a healing rain capable of mending wounds. Since rain falls only while the umbrella is open, you have to step out from under the umbrella to be healed."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_258,"A mechanical heart-shaped tool. Once the gears inside have been activated, it has the peculiar ability to make broken objects or unconscious people move once again."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_259,"An armillary sphere with the power of regeneration. The jewel in the center's healing power is amplified by the sphere itself, boosting its effect tenfold. Touching it heals minor injuries instantly."

STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_261,"A wooden flute made to look like the forest. It makes a calming sound like a breeze through the treetops. But, paradoxically, those who hear it are filled with vigor."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_262,"An hourglass with an interior that seems to hold an entire universe. When the stars inside it move, a divine power is invoked to protect the user. It cannot be used to tell time."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_263,"Try giving this a spin whenever you feel depressed or unmotivated. The faster the device spins, the more it fills the user with vitality. It practically forces you to get motivated and energized."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_264,"A magic tool made of several magical orbs with a variety of effects. It can keep all sorts of misfortune at bay. However, if even one of the orbs is lost, the band is rendered completely useless."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_265,"A banner that was made to boost citizen morale during a previous war-torn era. While it possesses the power to encourage those around it, it must be continuously waved by a member of royalty standing at the front line to be effective."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_266,"A shuttlecock steeped in miasma. It explodes on impact, spreading the unpleasant stuff inside. As for how it earned its name, anyone who gets hit by it will soon find out."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_267,A dangerous chest full of poisonous mushroom spores. No other explanation is needed. It's simple and dangerous. It's simply dangerous.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_268,"A cube containing an ancient, horrifying monster. While the exact identity of the creature contained within is unknown, breaking the seal to sate one's curiosity is extremely ill-advised."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_269,"A grimoire that conceals untold might. By summoning power from another dimension, it can weaken enemies and turn the tide of battle."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_270,"A negative aura trapped inside a coffin. Despite being sealed, the aura is so sinister that it's leaking out from the sides. Just being near it feels dangerous. What would happen if someone opened it?"
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_271,"A processed chunk of metal collected from ore. Ingots are commonly used to make metal weapons and tools, so people often stockpile a lot of them."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_272,"Cloth made by weaving various kinds of threads, from fabric thread to metal fibers. Despite looking like regular cloth, the weight and toughness of the metal fibers make it perfect for making armor."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_273,"Sweet, viscous liquid gathered from beehives. Its high nutritional value makes it a popular health food and ingredient for cooking."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_274,"Water that has been boiled, condensed into steam, then collected when cool. This process removes any impurities, resulting in incredibly pure water."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_275,"Your everyday, average flour. While most commonly used as an ingredient in cooking and baking, these fine particles can also become an incendiary device when properly applied."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_276,A strange ball gathered from inside a shining rainbow-colored Puni. It's as squishy as a Puni and a bit cold to the touch. Throwing it makes it bounce really high.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_277,"A strange ball gathered from inside a giant Puni. It's as squishy as a Puni and feels a bit cold when hugged. Throwing it makes it bounce really high, but doing so is dangerous due to its large size."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_281,"A basic alchemical solution. Even novice alchemists can easily synthesize it to test their skills, but it requires precision to extract its full power. Red Neutralizer has an affinity to fire."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_282,"A basic alchemical solution. Even novice alchemists can easily synthesize it to test their skills, but it requires precision to extract its full power. Blue Neutralizer has an affinity to ice."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_283,"A basic alchemical solution. Even novice alchemists can easily synthesize it to test their skills, but it requires precision to extract its full power. Yellow Neutralizer has an affinity to bolt."

STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_285,"Rock salt produced from water with high sodium content. It can be used as a stone building material, but it's still salt—it tastes salty and dissolves when exposed to water."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_286,"Spider's silk spun together to be as thick as regular thread. The silk used to spin this thread was already tough and hard to cut, so this thread is practically impossible to cut."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_287,"A medicinal powder made to treat illnesses that regular medicine can't treat. It can cause more harm than good when taken by people who aren't sick, so the directions have to be followed closely."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_288,"A magical tome detailing techniques to draw out the power of plants. You could always sit down and read it, but using it as an alchemical ingredient is a much easier way to release its power."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_289,A tool made from the remains of ancient creatures. Using this tool for synthesis will draw out the animals' power hidden within and enhance the tool's efficacy.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_290,"A bell created using trees from a vast forest. Despite using no metal, the bell makes a clear and beautiful sound. Legend has it that whoever rings it will be protected from evil."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_291,"A bottle filled with highly refined extracts of flammable plants. A tiny spark would be enough to ignite the liquid into a fire that would burn for a long, long time, and be a disaster for the user."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_292,"A piece of amber that is completely free of impurities. Despite being considered a type of jewel, it is flammable and can be used as a fuel source. Of course, you'd lose the amber if you used it like that."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_293,"A light, seemingly empty pot that contains a gaseous poison. Despite being sealed, the gas inside is leaking out ever so slightly, so try to keep it away from your face."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_294,"Grass with a beautiful red color. It looks like a flower when seen from far away, but looking closely reveals it to be an intertwined bundle of grass."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_295,A very tough cloth. It was created for people who want to make sturdy clothing with unique designs.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_296,"Metal that resembles a transparent jewel. It's divided into two layers, but this isn't two separate pieces of the same metal stacked on top of each other. It's quite heavy, so it's not an ideal replacement for real jewels."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_297,A red stone with white specks. It was named after its resemblance to a poisonous mushroom cap.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_298,"A veil made from Ende Guide wings. It's processed with a special liquid to prevent the wings from shedding scales, which gives it a brownish color. Quite small, so it can only cover up tiny things."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_299,A bottle of glittering purple sand. The purple color comes from the poisonous substance used to make the sand. It would obviously be a bad idea to touch this with your hands.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_300,A purple crystal gathered in the Sea of Decay that contains a special power. The most effective way to release the crystal's power is to use it for synthesis.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_301,A peculiar wooden plank that changes color depending on the environment. One theory is that the fungus contained in the wood used to make these boards is the reason it changes colors.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_302,"A transparent, bright cyan jewel. It was originally purple, but exposure to strong light has turned it cyan. This seems to be the best form to tap into the full power of this jewel."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_303,A gas with a peculiar aroma created from refined iron scraps. It has a mildly metallic fragrance with a delicate astringent finish. Not everyone likes the strange scent.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_304,"A slimy and rubbery jelly. It sticks to your hands if you touch it, but squeeze it all you like—nothing will make it lose its shape. Despite how it looks, this is a metal, so please don't eat it."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_305,"A plate made from Damascal Stone. The refining process causes the material to lose its characteristic patterns, turning it instead into a silver and black sheet."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_306,A crystal ball with a marbled pattern. The coloring comes from the three distinct forces contained within mixing together.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_307,"A pair of oddly powerful cords bundled up in a twisting spiral. The two forces pull on each other like a magnet, keeping them firmly entwined."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_308,"A pinwheel that emits poisonous power from its blades when they spin, flinging the substance into its surroundings. Generally considered to be too dangerous to use."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_309,A jewel made by refining coral. The pink and silver mottling are vestiges of the ingredients used in its production.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_310,"A device built upon the theories surrounding perpetual energy. However, as it has not been operating for all that long, it is still too early to say whether or not it will truly last forever (or even a respectable amount of time)."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_311,Cloth made from the flesh of an Angular Cactus. It goes without saying that any attempts to construct anything with it would end badly. Wearing clothing made from this would be even worse.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_312,"An ingot made from Bismuth Crystal. Thanks to having been reshaped into a form that is easier to use, its usefulness has increased exponentially."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_313,"Metal parts made from Steeleaf. The resulting pieces are so stunningly solid, it's hard to believe that they were made from plant material."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_314,"An octahedral crystal of bismuth. It's very pretty, but there's something mysterious about it. It makes you want to waste an entire day just staring at it."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_315,"A sturdy precious stone in the shape of a shield. It has such a beautifully clear, light blue color that it becomes completely invisible when placed in water."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_316,A hazardous substance from long ago that was so dangerous it was lost to time. Hopefully reviving this in the modern age doesn't prove to be a terrible mistake ...
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_317,"A coil arranged into the shape of a clover. It may look like the coils are merely stuck together, but this design was meticulously fine-tuned to produce dramatically more power than four coils used normally."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_318,A black hole created using alchemy. Even its creator doesn't know what happens to things that get sucked into it. It's probably best not to think about how sturdy the bottle holding the black hole is.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_319,"A rare ingot with a mysterious hue. It's easy to work with despite being impressively solid, so for adept crafters, mass-producing sturdy armor and powerful weapons with this isn't beyond the realm of possibility."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_320,"Soft cloth that is an absolute delight to touch. While the fabric is rather light, it exceeds most armor in terms of durability. As a result, it is considered to be a top-tier crafting material."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_321,"A potion packed full of condensed mana. Although it's highly poisonous for human beings, scattering this liquid over arid land revitalizes it, making it capable of supporting plant life once more."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_322,"A chain of three lockets, each containing jewels. As they are rather fragile, they were cast smaller and joined together in an attempt to make them more durable. This makes the piece look larger, too."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_323,"Lightning stored within a transparent container. While it might look beautiful, there is an obscene amount of energy concealed within the bolt. Should the container break, it would be released in an instant. Handle with the utmost care."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_324,A genuine piece of stone from a castle rampart. It was made to be quite sturdy—likely with potential assaults on the structure in mind.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_325,"Made from multiple kinds of timber that have been stacked together, this lumber is both durable and able to adapt to all sorts of situations."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_326,"A strange part made from an assortment of gears. It has all kinds of potential to unlock, but it's up to the crafter to use it in a way that will do so."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_327,"A mystical flower that has been placed inside a vessel. Said to be able to maintain its current state for an eternity, it glows with a pale light."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_328,Liquid medicine extracted from various plants and flowers. The bottle contains a herbarium comprised of the plants and flowers the medicine was extracted from.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_329,"A sturdy chain with sharp spikes. It has many uses, but it's as dangerous as it looks, even for the user. Its aggressive appearance has led people to believe it was created for nefarious purposes."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_330,This substance is the ultimate goal of all alchemists. This stone of infinite possibilities is said to possess omniscient and omnipotent power. It can only be created by the most skilled alchemists in the world.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_331,"A staff modified into a gunstaff. Although it is sturdy enough to be used as a weapon, the core materials are rather light, so strikes from it don't pack much of a punch."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_332,"A gunstaff with a white floral motif. The barrel draws mana from its surroundings, making it easy to replenish your stores while using it."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_333,"A gunstaff with a vintage finish. Made with more wood than other models, it was designed to withstand recoil and reverberations made by physical attacks. This weapon can be pushed right to the limits of its power."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_334,"A gunstaff designed to draw out its maximum potential when used for either shooting or striking. The lamp is lit by condensed mana, and the gun's internal structure allows it to withstand tremendous amounts of force."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_335,"A spear with a tip fashioned from a jewel. Its simple construction is geared towards beginners. Should the spearhead break, it can be replaced without having to modify any other part."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_336,"A spear inspired by traveling. Guideposts and weather vanes are clear motifs, complete with a spearhead reminiscent of a star sparkling in the night sky. It's apparently quite popular among female adventurers."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_337,"A spear whose tip has the appearance of a blossoming flower. This unique shape is lost on those being stabbed, however, as it can only be seen from its wielder's point of view."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_338,"A spear where the tip has been formed into a spiral. While straight thrusts would certainly do the job, a few twists of the wrist have the potential to drive the point in even deeper."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_339,"A pistol and dagger that are compact in size, making them easy to wield. The dagger is light and incredibly sharp, while the pistol boasts impressive firepower. However, due to its strong recoil, it takes some time to get used to."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_340,"A pair of weapons adorned in gothic decorations. At a glance, the decorations seem to be for aesthetic purposes only, but they actually serve to suppress recoil when shooting and augment the blade's strength."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_341,"A pair of weapons designed to resemble flora. Not only do they look like a flower, but they're also as lightweight as one, making them particularly easy to wield."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_342,"A pair of weapons created via refined alchemical techniques. The shock created when the pistol is fired is infinitesimally small, and the dagger can cut through even the thickest steel with just a modest swipe of its blade."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_343,"A weapon that can be used both for attack and defense. However, it's so prohibitively heavy that few are able to wield it properly, making it a point of pride for those who can."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_344,"A shield packed with minute mechanisms. Designed to assist any and all of the wielder's actions, this piece packs a serious punch."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_345,"A shield made with offensive attacks in mind. The pile power has been pushed to the utmost limit, resulting in almost explosive attacks with accompanying kickback. Only the strongest, most tenacious folks can master one of these."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_346,"A shield without any complicated mechanisms, focused instead on maximized sturdiness and power. Despite being made from a single steel plate, it can repel any attack thrown at it and strike down any enemy that stands in its way."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_347,"A scythe that has been modified for use in battle. It still hacks and slashes, but it can also be used as a gun. It needs to be swung with a fair bit of force as the blade isn't very sharp."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_348,"A scythe whose blade has been made from a single steel plate. While its construction is simple, the edge has been sharpened to such a fine point that simply grazing it is enough to slice."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_349,"A scythe made from bones. The clawlike portions at the tip of the blade are wickedly sharp, while the rest of the gnarled pieces offer stinging pain when used to deal damage as a blunt weapon."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_350,A scythe that looks positively demonic. The sinister blades can cut clean through iron and are barbed so that escape is impossible once stabbed.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_351,"A sword whose blade has been turned into a chain. Cutting more like a saw than a traditional sword, it leaves its targets with awful wounds that are difficult to heal and prone to scarring."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_352,"A wooden sword covered in gnarled sections. To no one's surprise, it is not in the least bit sharp. However, in the right hands, this sword can carve up whatever it touches."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_353,"A sword with a jagged edge. Made from thin metal that has been carefully honed to a fine point, the saw-like blade cuts just as cleanly as a straight-edged weapon."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_354,"A sword made from a type of stone even more durable than metal. At first glance, the blade appears more like a pelt than either material—which is why decorative fur has been added to the base of the hilt."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_355,"Clothing that can adapt to different climates and environments. All good travelers carry one with them on their journeys. It's not exactly the most practical design for daily wear, though."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_356,An outfit made for adventurers. The name comes from its widespread popularity among relic hunters.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_357,"A robe colored like a fairy. Light yet warm, this is a favorite among adventurers. However, the vivid fabric makes it impossible for the wearer to blend into their surroundings."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_358,"Armor worn by soldiers who fight on horseback, designed to be easy to move in and decorated elegantly. That being said, few people have the skill to fight on horseback, so not many people wear it."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_359,"Golden armor said to have been commissioned by an emperor who once united the world. Despite being incredibly sturdy, rumor has it that it was so radiant that even the emperor refused to wear it."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_360,"An outfit designed for a high-ranking clergy member. Made from only the finest materials with great magical properties, it's said to safeguard the wearer from any and all forms of disaster."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_361,"Clothing designed for the battlefield. In addition to guarding against regular attacks from weaponry, it also holds up extremely well against the teeth and claws of monsters and beasts. It does not, however, reduce the impact of these blows, so injuries can still happen."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_362,"Armor used by soldiers in the old ages. It's exceptionally well-designed, and the structure has the unique ability to disperse impacts to lessen damage. It's also built to be incredibly durable."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_363,"Armor made by processing dense stone. Anyone attempting to wear it normally would be crushed to death under its weight, so it's been lightened via magic. But it's still hard to move around in and reduces mobility."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_364,"Clothing once worn by a person known as the ""Overtaker."" Many wish they could wear this outfit, but it chooses its owner, giving an electric shock to anyone it deems unworthy."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_365,"A crown inlaid with countless jewels. Legends say that it was given to a sorcerer of incredible wisdom long ago. The star, moon, and sun symbols are said to resonate with the ancient sorcerer's soul."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_366,"A scarf dyed using extract taken from the red portion of Paradise Grass. Its vivid red color is popular with ladies, but only a small amount of the extract can be gathered from each plant, making mass production impossible."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_367,"A ribbon accessory worn on the arm. It has the ability to ward off evil and helps repel weaker monsters. It's also effective against people with a guilty conscience, making it a popular fashion item."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_368,A ring produced from a purple crystal found in the Sea of Decay. The ring strengthens its wearer by drawing on the power contained within the crystal.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_369,"A bangle made for physical combatants. It assists with muscle movement, increasing the wearer's overall ease of motion. That being said, even wearing a large number of bangles does not allow one to surpass their body's limitations."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_370,"A pendant with a flower ornament said to have the power to heal the wearer. Many people use it as a protective amulet, and it's a custom to pass it down from generation to generation."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_371,"While at a glance this may just look like a beautiful ring, it is said to grant countless blessings upon whoever makes a wish on it."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_372,"An antique choker worn by famous tacticians of an age long since passed, as described in history textbooks. While they were previously used as status symbols, nowadays their function has been reduced to fashion."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_373,"A mask worn on stage by jesters. Originally used as a tool to hide a jester's face and entertain crowds, it has recently become an object of fear after being used by thieves and assassins."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_374,"A crystal that reflects the ideal world of its wearer. During a crisis, looking into the crystal may show you what lies beyond your current situation. There's no guarantee of it becoming real, but it can be reassuring."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_375,"Parts that were believed to have been used in transportation devices ridden by people in the past. However, putting them to work now would be dangerous, given that they have been neglected for so long."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_376,Old replacement parts that have been refurbished. Their improved handling makes them ideal pieces for use on transportation devices.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_377,"A letter written to the Neru by a member of the Research Team. It was meant as a symbol of friendship, but apparently it can be given to any Neru ... This won't cause any issues, will it?"
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_378,"A letter written by a Neru as thanks for the letter sent by the member of the Research Team. There is some question as to whether the writing can be read, but maybe the feeling will still be conveyed."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_379,"Rare ore extracted from a special monster. Taken from the hardest shell in the world, it's said to be useful as a building material, but will break quickly if used for a weapon."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_380,The bullets used by Nina's beloved gun. Not interchangeable with Yumia's bullets due to differences in shape.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_381,"Replacement parts that Yumia found which are believed to be used for a transportation device. At the present, Yumia cannot make sense of how to use them."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_382,Parts for the transportation device which were adjusted by Yumia into something she can use. This was made possible by using Flammi as a replacement for the power source.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_383,"Made by Yumia in order to move the giant roots blocking the way. It rapidly grows in a short amount of time, but its growth is difficult to control, so one must not use it carelessly."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_384,A new set of bows and quivers for the Welleks. Care has been taken to ensure their sturdiness after hearing that their old ones had broken.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_385,A device to help figure out Lenja's whereabouts. It can detect a person's unique mana signature and track them. It is used by attaching it to Flammi.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_386,"A simplified power source based on the mechanisms of the Energy Core. It is not a full reproduction, as it can only temporarily trap energy, but it's good enough to act as a device activator."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_387,The core component of the Mana Transposing Furnace. It is damaged and currently nonfunctional. Special materials are needed to restore it.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_388,A rare mineral with special properties that distorts the flow of mana around it. It is said to have been used in various devices and facilities in Aladiss.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_389,The Stirium-repaired core of the Mana Transposing Furnace. It controls large amounts of mana by utilizing Stirium's mana-distorting properties.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_390,"A customary necklace of the Flumme, Lenja's clan, given to those who have completed their journey of atonement as a sign of accomplishment. Made by Yumia after hearing Lenja's story."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_391,"Bullets made of Stirium designed to counter Corleonis's ice attacks. By pinpointing a massive amount of mana into one point, they boast high penetrative power, but cannot be mass-produced due to the rarity of the materials needed."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_392,Important documents that were dropped by a Research Team member. They contain information pertaining to the investigation of the Sivash region.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_423,An artificial crystal that activates the latent potential in mana. It could be of great help on your journey if used properly.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_424,A crystal fragment that contains the power of mana.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_425,"The most common bullet around. The impact when firing is mild enough that anyone can use it easily. It's suitable for self-defense, but it's not useful for things like smashing hard rocks."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_426,"Despite being the same size as a normal bullet, this one is designed to explode on impact. It packs enough firepower to reduce rocks and walls to rubble."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_427,"When fired, these bullets split into three parts and fly off in three different directions. While this quirk can take some getting used to, once mastered, it's possible to destroy multiple targets with a single shot."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_428,"Parts used to create special tools for repairing broken objects. By simply rearranging them, you can create something that will fit almost any situation."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_429,A box of tools for repairing wooden items. This single toolbox has everything you need for fixing furniture or wooden tools.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_430,A box of tools for repairing machinery. This one case carries everything one could possibly need to fix any mechanical equipment or devices.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_431,"A toolbox with everything needed to fix liquids and their related items. While obviously suited to liquid repair, it can also mend whatever it was contained in without any issues."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_432,"A toolbox used to repair things that don't fall under the lumber, machinery, or liquid categories. The assortment of odds and ends contained within should make it possible to fix most random items."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_433,"A box packed with common foodstuffs. As long as a person can cook for themselves, they can make a meal from what's found in this box."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_434,A box of uncommon ingredients that would delight any avid cook or chef. It's full of ingredients that can't be found in shops and are otherwise hard to prepare.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_435,"A box full of fine ingredients used by first-class chefs. Even fancy restaurants hardly stock these ingredients, and regular people have never seen half of the contents. Truly a box for the chosen few."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_436,A bag carefully packed with all the tools anyone would need to have a comfortable camping experience. But people who prefer to pack light might not like how big the bag is.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_437,Simple bandages for treating wounds. They're fine for minor scrapes but aren't quite enough to help with major bleeding or to firmly secure injuries.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_438,"A bandage made from slightly better cloth. While it excels at staunching blood, it also does a splendid job of firmly securing any injured areas."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_439,"A bandage made from high-quality cloth. Made from pain-mitigating materials, these are used to speed up the recovery process."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_440,"Gloves necessary to use ziplines. Without them, grasping the ropes of light would be impossible. They become tattered with continual use and must be replaced regularly."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_441,A key used to gain access to treasure troves found across the land. It doesn't need to be placed in a keyhole—the mana inside the key unlocks the door. It only has enough mana to be used once.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_442,"A stack of pancakes piled impossibly high. Despite being seemingly impossible, here it is. This stack of pancakes has made the impossible possible."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_443,Shells sandwiched in a maritozzo pastry. A shell was placed on top to make it look even fancier. This blend of sweet cream and seafood will bring a smile to some faces and a frown to others.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_444,"A salad made using Uni. Taste aside, this is one hard-to-eat salad. Who would put whole Uni on a plate like this without shelling it?"
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_445,"A spicy seafood curry packed with fresh fish and chili peppers. As the cooked tomato made to look like a bomb might imply, this curry is very spicy. People say that's what makes it so addictive."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_447,A simple ladder made from wooden bars and rope. You can hang this when descending from a high place to avoid detours on your return. It's a good idea to look for spots where you can hang one before dropping down.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_448,"A necessary tool when fishing. This is a basic lure with absolutely no special features. But, for some reason, fish still seem to love nibbling on it."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_449,An orb which unleashes a tremendous impact when shattered. Can be used during battle to temporarily blow away enemies.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_450,"A handy tool for uncovering treasure chests. Use this, and you'll never miss another hidden cache again. It will indicate gathering points for rare ingredients if there aren't any chests nearby."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_451,"Strands so beautiful, they may well have drifted down from the heavens. The clear blue threads shimmer in a way that makes it look like stars are held inside them."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_452,"Neutralizers are fundamental chemicals frequently used in alchemy. Some refinements have resulted in this all-purpose one, which can be used with any and all potential ingredients."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_453,"An exoskeleton dropped by a leader among monsters. It's lightweight but sturdy, making it the perfect material for armor."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_454,"A crystal dropped by a leader among monsters. They are only produced in monsters with exceedingly long lifespans, though the nature of how they are produced is still a mystery."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_455,A special feather obtained from a leader among monsters. It is durable and emits faint air energy. These feathers are buried deep within the wing and are seldom seen as a result.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_456,A front tooth obtained from a leader among monsters. These teeth are used to crunch through tough nuts and the bones of prey. Even hitting them with a hammer is not enough to smash them.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_457,An animal pelt obtained from a leader among monsters. It bears scars from years of battle but has been specially treated to be incredibly sturdy. None of its scars appear to be from a fatal attack.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_458,Massive pincers obtained from a leader among monsters. These thick pincers are as hard as stone and capable of crushing boulders. Merely swinging them like a weapon is enough to do some serious damage.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_459,A special soul obtained from a leader among monsters. The monster's life force was so powerful that it retained this hyper-condensed shape long after the owner's flesh had decayed.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_460,"A sturdy hide obtained from a leader among monsters. It both protects from enemy attacks and can be used to attack thanks to its sharp scales. Knives have a tough time cutting through, making it difficult to process."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_461,"A special staff obtained from a leader among monsters. It was originally a simple wooden staff but has since been adorned with ivy, mushrooms, and other vegetation. Monsters find this staff quite extravagant."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_462,"A shining scale dropped by a leader among monsters. These scales are much stronger than regular rock raptor scales, and they glitter like jewels. However, they are much less valuable than they appear."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_463,An electrically charged organ obtained from a leader among monsters. The organ inside the gelatinous orb continuously emits electricity. The orb itself can be touched with bare hands but will release a high-voltage current if split open.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_464,"A protector used to keep a golem's core safe. When installed over the core, it can disperse impacts directed towards it."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_465,Claws obtained from the leader of a monster pack. Each claw is equipped with small barbs to prevent captured prey from escaping.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_466,"A special necklace owned by Geni leaders, made from an assortment of scrap metal. Meant to be worn by only a select few, these ornaments include some rather rare metals in their construction."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_467,"A uniquely-shaped pearl carried by Neru leaders which is often accented with coral and shells. Used largely as a protective charm, these are usually set into rods."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_468,"A quick and easy minestrone soup. There aren't many ingredients added to the stock, so it can be eaten without a spoon."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_469,"An oven-baked pizza, made with meticulous care. The simple toppings have been generously piled on, making it a more filling meal than it might look."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_470,"Pasta coated in a sauce made from medicinal herbs. While there is a noticeable bitterness to it, this arrangement beats eating raw leaves by leaps and bounds."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_471,"A curry made from only the freshest fish available. Although there is a lingering seafood scent, it pairs perfectly with the curry, resulting in a delicious dish."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_472,A simple dish of omelet rice smothered in a rich demi-glace sauce. Children love this even more than adults do.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_473,"A hamburger piled high with three thick patties. The stack isn't entirely stable, and it's far too bulky to eat without utensils, but the flavor is unparalleled."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_474,Steak grilled on a piping hot crystal. The taste of the meat is said to change based on the latent power of the crystal being used to do the cooking.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_475,"A whole roasted Old Master, as the name describes. While the cooking method gives it a rather wild feeling, it really is the best way to enjoy this particular species."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_476,"A rich stew, with ingredients cut on the slightly larger side. Since it is slowly simmered, the flavors have plenty of time to permeate whatever gets thrown into the pot, making for a soothing meal that melts in your mouth."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_483,"For anyone who has ever thought, ""I love this piece of furniture, but if only it was a different color!"" this brush is for you! This marvelous tool will paint in the exact hue your heart desires, without ever going outside the lines."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_484,"A necessary item for anyone looking to recolor their furniture. While it might look monochromatic, using it with the matching brush allows you to switch to any shade you could imagine. Truly, a remarkable tool."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_485,"A relic treasure that has spent considerable time in the woods. Practically drowning in moss and ivy, it's impossible to tell at a glance just how valuable it is (or isn't)."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_486,"Fragments of antique pottery. Their broken, dirt-stained form is almost indistinguishable from regular trash. It's only by picking them up and polishing them off that their true status as a relic treasure becomes apparent."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_487,"A bundle covered in mushrooms and other forms of fungi. By all appearances, this relic treasure looks like a poisonous mass. Since most sensible folk would avoid touching it entirely, stumbling across one of these really is a lucky find."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_488,"Some sort of fragments buried in fungus, mushrooms, and more fungus. Despite being a relic treasure of relative value, the degree to which they have been covered makes them exceedingly difficult to spot."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_489,"A rust-covered relic treasure made from materials that do not exist in the current era. Although it looks corroded, polishing the surface will make it shine."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_490,"A battered, rusted relic treasure that was abandoned ages ago. Only the rust is a relatively new addition—the chips and scratches on it are actually part of the original design."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_491,"Some sort of component that was repaired for reuse by alchemists in the Aladissian Era. That it has been recycled is a testament to the alchemical skills present in that period, leading to it being considered a relic treasure now."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_492,"This strange sort of metal looks as though it was newly forged. In actuality, this relic was made several hundreds of years ago, but has seemingly escaped the ravages of time. It is an unusual specimen even among relic treasures."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_493,"Food for animals, just like the name suggests. It has been prepared in a way that makes it suitable for any animal."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_494,"A ball that emits enough smoke to temporarily cloud one's vision. If used during an enemy encounter, it will create an opening to escape."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_495,A special bottle that can be used to hold Alstahlia nectar. It is an invaluable tool for the Silva Welleks.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_496,A bottle packed full of Alstahlia nectar. The nectar can be used as a substitute for energy.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_497,"A cluster collected from a gigantic monster. Impurities clumped together inside the monster's body hardened over a long period of time until finally becoming like stone. Because it's extremely difficult to extract, it's said to be as valuable as a gem."
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_498,A badge awarded to veteran Puni fighters. Just wearing this makes one feel that they can learn the innermost secrets of fighting Puni.
STR_LIBRARY_ITEM_499,Training equipment used to help build a sturdy body capable of enduring harsh investigative work. Wearing this during battles provides more efficient training.

STR_LIBRARY_HELP_000,"Quality represents <CLEG>how skillfully an item has been crafted. The higher an item's quality, the more powerful it will be.<CLNR> The quality of the items you synthesize is determined by the quality of the materials you use."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_001,"An item's level indicates the degree of skill required to use it. You <CLEG>cannot synthesize items<CLNR> with an Item Level higher than your current Alchemy Level. Equipping an item also incurs an equip cost equal to its Item Level, so <CLEG>think carefully about which items to take with you while exploring<CLNR>."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_002,"An item's rank indicates its overall value, taking both its quality and traits into account. The six possible ranks, from lowest to highest, are <CLEG>E, D, C, B, A, and S<CLNR>."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_003,"All items belong to an item category, such as (Water) or (Uni). Some items belong to two or more categories. <CLEG>Synthesis often requires materials from particular categories, so items that belong to multiple categories offer valuable versatility<CLNR>."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_004,Some items are restricted and <CLEG>can only be equipped to the characters specified<CLNR>.
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_005,Synthesis allows you to combine materials listed in recipes to create <CLEG>a wide variety of items<CLNR>. Interact with the cauldron in your atelier to start synthesizing.
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_006,"Recipes detail the materials required to synthesize an item, as well as the effects that can be applied to it. You must choose a recipe to follow in order to start synthesizing. <CLEG>New recipes can be obtained from reference books or devised by Sophie<CLNR>."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_007,"Every item has 1-4 panels called components. All components are aligned with 1 or more of 5 elements: <CLEG>fire, ice, lightning, wind, or light<CLNR>. Synthesis is conducted by placing components on the synthesis panel."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_008,"Place components on the synthesis panel to raise the item's quality and effect levels. Quality increases with the <CLEG>total number of panels filled<CLNR>, while effect levels increase with the <CLEG>number of components with the associated element<CLNR>."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_009,"If one component is placed on top of another, <CLEG>the older component will sink down and disappear from the synthesis panel<CLNR>. Sunken panels lower effect levels, but provide a boost to quality."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_010,Effects are <CLEG>inherent abilities possessed by synthesized items and some materials<CLNR>. Up to 4 effects can be applied during synthesis. Available effects are determined by the recipe you are following.
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_011,"Effect levels are required to apply effects to items. Each effect has an associated element, and <CLEG>its level is raised by placing components with that element on the synthesis panel<CLNR>. Some locations on the synthesis panel have elemental alignments, and placing a component with the same element there will yield a further bonus to the effect level. Effect levels have an upper limit, and they cannot be increased past this maximum."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_012,"There are two kinds of components: ordinary components and <CLEG>link components, which can create links<CLNR>. Links are formed by placing two link components of the same element adjacent to one another. <CLEG>The maximum effect level of an element increases according to the number of links of that element<CLNR>, making link components vital to creating items with powerful effects."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_013,"The latent abilities of items are called ""traits"". Traits are inherited from the materials used during synthesis. <CLEG>An item may have up to 3 associated traits<CLNR>."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_014,"Sometimes <CLEG>two traits inherited from materials will combine to produce a single, more powerful trait<CLNR> in a process called Trait Fusion. Many different combinations of traits can trigger Trait Fusion, but it most commonly occurs between traits with similar effects. Some traits can only be acquired through Trait Fusion."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_015,Selecting <IM17> Auto-Add Materials while adding materials will fill out the synthesis panel automatically. Note that automatic component placement is less efficient at forming links and increasing effect levels.<CLEG>This feature is most useful for synthesizing items quickly and in large quantities<CLNR>.
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_016,"You can choose whether to synthesize items with Sophie or Plachta from the recipe selection screen. Some recipes are <CLEG>exclusive to Sophie or Plachta<CLNR>, so you may need to change characters in order to synthesize the items you want."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_017,"Catalysts are special items which can only be used while synthesizing and <CLEG>allow you to break some of the rules of synthesis<CLNR>. Improve their effects to unlock new alchemical abilities, such as preventing components from sinking or flipping the components horizontally."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_018,Restricted panels are the more advanced synthesis panels where some spaces are missing. <CLEG>Some item effects can only be achieved by using restricted panels<CLNR>.
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_019,"Assist skills can be activated by your party members during synthesis. <CLEG>They have powerful effects, such as improving quality or supplying additional panels or materials, that can help you craft better items.<CLNR> Note that assist skills can only be activated after forming a certain number of links with the character's associated element. A character's assist skill can be unlocked by deepening your friendship with them. <CLEG>Your friendship with a character can be improved by advancing their storyline.<CLNR>"
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_020,"Every item you synthesize has a chance of achieving a Super Success, which <CLEG>greatly improves the quality of the finished product<CLNR>. The chance of a Super Success increases with the number of squares you fill on the synthesis panel, and increases further as you fill in complete rows and columns."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_021,Performing certain actions or fulfilling certain conditions will inspire Sophie to <CLEG>devise new recipes<CLNR>. You can check the criteria for unlocking new recipes in the Recipe Ideas section of the main menu.
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_022,"The Recipe Tree shows <CLEG>the order in which you can unlock new recipes<CLNR>. When you unlock recipes connected to others with lines, you will receive hints for the next adjacent devisable recipe. Recipes that can be devised will be marked with ""?"" icons. Important recipes are marked with a yellow border, and hints to unlocking them will become available <CLEG>as you progress through the story<CLNR>."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_023,"A battle will start when you make contact with an enemy in the field. Battles are <CLEG>won by reducing all the enemies' HP to 0<CLNR>. Conversely, <CLEG>you will lose if all your allies' HP reaches 0<CLNR>."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_024,"The basic commands available to you in battle are as follows:<CR>- Attack<CR>Use your character's normal attack to deal damage to the enemy.<CR>- Skill<CR>Spend MP to use one of your character's powerful special moves.<CR>- Item<CR>Use one of your character's equipped items.<CR>- Block<CR>Block incoming attacks until your next turn, greatly reducing damage taken.<CR>- Flee<CR>Run away from battle. Your odds of successfully running away from an in-progress battle will increase the more times you have used the command."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_025,"Actions in battle will sometimes result in your allies or enemies being affected by status effects. There are two kinds of status effects: permanent and temporary.<CR>- Permanent Status Effects<CR><CLEG>Permanent status effects will not wear off over time; they will persist until removal or a KO. <CLNR>They have a severity level from 1-5, which increases every time they are applied, and their effects intensify at higher levels.<CR>- Temporary Status Effects<CR>Temporary status effects have no severity level and wear off after a sufficient number of turns have passed."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_026,"Many actions you can take in battle have elemental characteristics. Targeting your enemies' elemental vulnerabilities is a reliable way to deal high damage, while your damage will be greatly reduced when you use elements enemies are resistant to. There are two kinds of elements: primary and secondary. Actions with no associated element are considered non-elemental.<CR>- Primary Elements<CR>There are two primary elements: physical and magic.<CR>- Secondary Elements<CR>There are four secondary elements: fire, ice, lightning, and wind."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_027,"During battle, your party will be divided between the Attack team and the Back-up team. Each team can have up to three members. <CLEG>Switching party members efficiently between your two teams is an integral part of any battle<CLNR>."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_028,The Attack team fights the enemy directly on the front lines. Only members of the Attack team can perform commands in battle or be targeted by enemy attacks.
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_029,"The Back-up team supports their allies from behind. Members of the Back-up team cannot perform actions unless prompted, and can typically only act in response to special commands taken by the attack team. If the attack team is wiped out, the back-up team is forced into battle in their place."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_030,"You can equip talismans to strengthen your party members' block abilities in a variety of ways. Some confer improved damage reduction, while others activate special effects on opting to block or successfully blocking an attack."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_031,TP (Technical Points) are <CLEG>required to perform certain special commands<CLNR>. They are accumulated by performing basic commands such as attacking or blocking. Your accumulated TP vanish at the end of each battle and cannot be carried over.
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_032,"A Twin Action is a <CLEG>special command in which a member of the back-up team and a member of the attack team change places with a combination attack<CLNR>. Using a Twin Action reduces the MP cost of skills by 10, but prevents TP gain. Twin Actions cost 1 TP to perform and cannot be performed if you have insufficient TP. You cannot select charged skills for the first part of a Twin Action, and for the second attack you can only select the skills and items that target enemies directly."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_033,A Support Guard is a special command in which <CLEG>a member of the Back-up team instantly swaps places with the target of an incoming attack<CLNR>. The Back-up team member enters the battle blocking and continues to block until their next turn. Support Guard costs 1 TP to perform and cannot be performed if you have insufficient TP.
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_034,"The DG (Dual Gauge) is required to use Dual Triggers. It fills a little every time you use a normal attack, and fills by a larger amount whenever you use a Twin Action or a Support Guard. The DG is preserved between battles, but note that the highest value you can carry over is 100%."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_035,"<CLEG>Once the DG is at 100% or greater, you can use a Dual Trigger<CLNR>. Select another character to deplete the DG completely and unleash a powerful combination attack with damage based on the DG charge consumed. You may use a Dual Trigger any number of times per battle."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_036,"Time Cards are issued by certain skills and items. They have their own place in the turn order and their own activation count. When their turn arrives, their effect activates and their count decreases by 1. A new Time Card of the same type as an existing one will be added to the older card's count instead of creating a new Time Card."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_037,"Charged Skills are skills that have powerful effects, but require multiple turns to activate. When you use a Charged Skill, your character will begin to charge up, limiting the actions they can take. <CLEG>If they become unable to act before they finish charging (through sleep, paralysis, KO, and so on), their charge will be interrupted<CLNR>."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_038,"The weather in the overworld can affect battles. Your enemies may become stronger in certain environmental conditions, and you may have to contend with lightning strikes, blizzards, and other damaging hazards. Certain enemies even possess skills that can affect the weather around them."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_039,"Enemies shrouded in an aura will take less damage and use Reaction Skills when attacked. <CLEG>The second part of a Twin Action is not affected by this damage reduction<CLNR>. Exploiting an aura's weaknesses will not only deal larger damage to the Aura Gauge, but also <CLEG>cancel any Reaction Skills<CLNR>."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_040,"If you successfully deplete an enemy's aura gauge, its aura will be broken. Enemies with broken auras take increased damage and are prevented from acting for 1 turn. <CLEG>A party member who breaks an enemy's aura gains bonus TP and can immediately act again<CLNR>."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_041,Winning a battle will sometimes reward you with items. Dispatch your enemies with greater style and efficiency to earn a better chance at rare drops.
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_042,Tailor the combat experience to your preference by selecting from multiple difficulty levels. The difficulty can be adjusted from the Options menu at any time. Please note that battle rewards are uniform at all difficulties below Very Hard.<CR>Note: Some difficulty levels will only become available after completing the game.
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_043,- Easy<CR>Enemies are weaker and their attacks are less threatening.<CR>- Normal<CR>The optimal difficulty setting.<CR>- Hard<CR>Enemies pose a slightly greater challenge.<CR>- Very Hard<CR>Enemies pose a significantly greater challenge and use more powerful skills.<CR>- Charismatic (unlocked after completing the game)<CR>Enemies are punishing and can act more frequently.
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_044,"When you are defeated during an important battle, you will be prompted to choose one of the following:<CR>- Retry Battle<CR>- Save Progress and Return to Atelier<CR>- Load Saved Game"
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_045,"Stats indicate various parameters associated with your party members' abilities.<CR>- Lv.<CR>Raising a character's level will improve all of their stats and sometimes unlock new skills.<CR>- HP<CR>Taking damage reduces a character's HP. If it reaches 0, they will be KOd and can no longer fight.<CR>- MP<CR>MP is required to activate skills in battle."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_046,"- ATK<CR>Affects the damage of attacks, skills, and other offensive actions.<CR>- DEF<CR>Affects damage taken.<CR>- SPD<CR>Affects the wait time between actions, as well as the chance of landing critical hits.<CR>- Quality<CR>Provides a scaling bonus to ATK, DEF, and SPD.<CR>- Equip Cost<CR>Equipping items incurs an equip cost proportional to their strength."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_047,Abilities are <CLEG>skills that bring various useful effect to battles and exploration<CLNR>. You can check each character's skills from the Abilities section of the main menu.
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_048,"As you increase your Battle Level and grow closer with your friends, you will acquire Ability Points, or AP for short. AP can be spent to learn new skills or improve existing ones. Powerful Bonus Skills will also become available after spending enough AP."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_049,Friendship indicates how close you have grown with each of your allies. Advance their stories and strengthen your relationships to gain access to a wide variety of bonuses.
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_050,You can gather alchemy materials and battle enemies while exploring various areas. Reaching certain locations and unlocking new areas may also be necessary to advance or trigger story events and quests.
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_051,"Gathered items will be temporarily stored in your basket. On returning to your atelier, they will be transferred to your container. You can check the contents of your container at any time while in town. Note that your basket and your container both have limited capacity."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_052,"Gathering spots are points where alchemy materials can be collected. Press <IM00> to pick them up, or swing an appropriate gathering tool with <IM04>, at a gathering spot to harvest the materials found there."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_053,"Your gathering rank indicates your expertise in gathering materials using your hands, staff, and other gathering tools. As your rank increases, you will be able to gather new materials from the same locations.<CR>Your gathering rank can be increased by Sophie's skills and the effects of your gathering tools. If you're struggling to find the materials you need, try improving your gathering rank before going out to search again."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_054,Gathering spots <CLEG>often yield different materials depending on the tool used<CLNR>. New materials can also be found by acquiring certain skills or using gathering tools that increase your gathering rank.
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_055,"The grass sickle can be used to gather plant materials from bushes.<CR>Good locations: grass, berry bushes, small trees, giant mushrooms, etc."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_056,"The fishing rod can be used to reel in fish and other aquatic creatures at fishing points.<CR>Good locations: waterside fishing spots, indicated by ripples and fish silhouettes."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_057,"The pickaxe can be used to mine useful stones and ore from large rocks.<CR>Good locations: small rocks, large rocks, stalactites, etc."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_058,The bug net can be used to capture bugs hiding in the undergrowth.<CR>Good locations: grass and bushes where bugs can be seen.

STR_LIBRARY_HELP_060,"The hammer can be used to break crystals to obtain ore and gemstones.<CR>Good locations: small crystals, large crystals, etc."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_061,"Time will pass as you explore. Each day is split into four time periods: <CLEG>morning, midday, evening, and night<CLNR>. As the time of day changes, different monsters may appear and different materials may become available from gathering spots. Note that some areas of the world are unaffected by time progression."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_062,"There are four kinds of weather to encounter in the overworld: <CLEG>sunshine, rain, thunderstorm, and snow<CLNR>. The weather in each area of the world is fixed and unaffected by time progression. <CLEG>Weather conditions may also affect battles in an area<CLNR>."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_063,"If you have a certain item in your possession, you can use Dreamspace Stones to change the weather to sunshine. While the sun is shining, <CLEG>any changes in the world caused by other weather conditions will be reset<CLNR>."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_064,"If you have a certain item in your possession, you can use Dreamspace Stones to change the weather to rain. Rainfall may bring about changes in the world, such as <CLEG>causing water levels in certain areas of the map to rise<CLNR>."

STR_LIBRARY_HELP_071,Equip exploration equipment to receive a wide variety of benefits in both exploration and combat. Add stronger effects to exploration equipment during synthesis to gain access to improved benefits.
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_072,"Tent Prototype 1 is a special exploration item that allows you to rest at <CLEG>bonfires<CLNR> found in various areas. Interact with a bonfire while you have the tent equipped to advance time and recover an amount of HP and MP. Much like attack and recovery items, Tent Prototype 1 has a limited number of uses."
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_073,Major gathering spots are rare and lucrative gathering points occasionally found in the world. They allow you to select the material you want to gather and then play a minigame (the Gathering Game) to choose their desired elemental components. You will be able to obtain higher quality materials from major gathering spots as the effect levels of your gathering tools increase.
STR_LIBRARY_HELP_074,"In the Grass Sickle Gathering Game, you can assign the moving components to your chosen materials by pressing <IM00> at the right time to stop them. By upgrading your Grass Sickle, you will be able to increase the number of the components you can assign up to 3."

STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_000,"A magical art which reconstructs materials by gathering recollected memories into a recipe and offering up ingredients. One must have the ability to manipulate mana in order to perform alchemy. As alchemy is taboo in the current era, there are no openly-practicing alchemists or even publicly-available documents on the subject."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_001,"The title given to a practitioner of alchemy. Having the ability to manipulate mana is essential to the craft, and Yumia performs synthesis by moving her body in grand, dance-like motions, as if physically manipulating the flow of mana. It's said that many alchemists conducted research in the Aladissian Empire during the past era."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_002,The act of combining ingredients through alchemy to create new materials. Recipes formed from a collection of memories are required to perform synthesis. The process generally involves the alchemist adding their own adjustments to the base recipe as they mix the ingredients together by manipulating mana.
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_003,"Memories accumulated from all living beings that have returned to the earth and coalesced into life energy. While it can be used in alchemy, it also has many other applications, such as powering machinery or revitalizing a person's body. However, mana in high concentrations can have detrimental effects on intelligent life."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_004,"Mana that has been liquefied through the use of a special technique. Allowing this to spread through one's surroundings protects against the negative effects of manabound areas. It does have other uses, but the ways in which it can be produced are limited. The proper term for it is ""mana energy."""
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_005,"A container designed to hold energy. This is the only way to store energy for long periods of time or transport it. Although Yumia has made some adjustments to it, the base construction is her mother's handiwork. While she may not be able to reproduce one at the moment, Yumia does attempt to improve it on a daily basis."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_006,"A calamity caused by large quantities of mana. When an ecosystem reaches maximum mana saturation, adverse effects can be felt and a manabound area may form. In principle, mana circulates through the earth on a fixed cycle, naturally preventing it from concentrating. Thus, the majority of mana disasters are caused by people."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_007,"An area where highly-concentrated mana has stagnated. Any intelligent life that enters such an area is subject to the effects of the massive collection of memories hidden within the mire, causing mental instability or even loss of consciousness. For this reason, the vast majority of Aladiss remains unexplored."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_008,"Another name for a manabound area. This term is uniquely used by the Welleks, so named because of the almost reverent fear they hold towards mana."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_009,"The term used to describe any phenomena related to mana. With a little bit of practice, almost anyone can create fire or wind by simply using the ambient mana present in the area, even without special talent. However, simple magic is only capable of things that are an extension of natural phenomena."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_010,"An illness that once spread throughout Aladiss. While its cause was uncertain at first, research showed that the rising concentration of mana caused by mana technology development was to blame. The disease was eradicated with the establishment of mana circulators across the empire, which controlled the mana density."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_011,"The Eustellan Republic's neighbor, separated by a sea. Although they did overpower other lands through their development of mana technology, the disaster it caused was their undoing. There are few documents from that time, so the detailed cause of the collapse and the surrounding context are largely unknown."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_012,"The Aladissian Empire's neighbor, separated by a sea. Having learned from their neighbor's ruinous end, they banned the use of alchemy. Most of the Research Team's members are from the Eustellan Republic. Rule of the region is split between the Five High Houses, with peace and public order maintained by the Order of Eustella."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_013,"The continent that was previously home to the Aladissian Empire. In the current age, the vast majority of the land is covered in manabound areas, making it both uninhabitable and largely unknown."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_014,"The continent in which the Eustellan Republic is located, and Yumia's birthplace. Due to its mild climate, it boasts the largest population of all of its neighbors."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_015,"Another name for the Aladissian Empire. Rumors passed around by adventurers that have since taken on a life of their own have led to it being called this, as little in the way of documentation remains from that era."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_016,"A Eustellan organization formed to survey the Eastern Continent and uncover what lies beneath the shroud of mana blanketing the former Aladissian Empire. Broadly speaking, their goal is to investigate the area and pioneer new land. The group is a mix of members from the Order of Eustella and adventurers gathered for their skills."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_017,"The organization that maintains public order within Eustella, ruled in turn by the five influential families that govern the land. The Order of Eustella is also the Research Team's main governing body, having dispatched a contingency of knights to participate, with Erhard leading them."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_018,"Adventurers focused on obtaining relics and documents from the past civilization, whether for riches, research, or a host of other reasons."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_019,"The five influential families that rule the Eustellan Republic. They are the Regenburg, the Nordheim, the Reihen, the Duerer, and the Stein."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_020,"The land that Viktor and Isla's family presides over. Three years ago, there was a massive explosion in the domain which caused a large number of casualties and forced many of those living in the territory to flee their homes. Yumia also comes from Duerer."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_021,A species of tiny folk who live all around the world. They are friendly to humans and quite happy to coexist with other species. Much about their way of life remains a mystery.
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_022,"A magical species that lives within Aladiss and is capable of communicating using the human language. Their slender figures, topped with mushroom-like caps, are their most defining features."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_023,A magical species that lives within Aladiss and is capable of communicating using the human language. Their bird-like plumages and beaks are their most defining features.
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_024,"Denotes any creature that looks similar to humans, but has differentiating features—such as larger ears, tails, and so on. A Welleks would be one such example."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_025,A demihuman species that possesses considerable physical strength and an aptitude for mana. A small number of them reside in Eustella. Welleks have their own unique culture with many customs. They are earnest and sincere with a respect for prayer.
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_026,"A Welleks clan that has continued to live in Aladiss even after the fall of the Aladissian Empire. Believing themselves to be partially responsible for Aladiss's collapse, they have made the most out of what little habitable area remains, living together and offering daily prayers to the land to atone for their perceived sins."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_027,"A Welleks clan that fled the Aladissian Empire during its fall, leaving the land entirely. When its members reach a certain age, they must embark on a journey of atonement, as per their customs. Lenja belongs to this clan."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_028,An artificial life form created through alchemy. While some are built entirely from scratch—including the soul—others are made by transplanting the memories of an existing human being.
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_029,A life form whose body has been altered by alchemy. The mutation process grants strength and intelligence far beyond that of a regular monster or human.
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_030,"The spiritual essence of every living creature. Memories accumulate within, growing it larger the more abundant they are. The soul returns to the earth upon death, melting away and becoming mana."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_031,"The dwelling place of the soul, and the container in which memories are accumulated. This is simply an interpretation of the concept—there isn't a physical vessel. Should this container become damaged, memories grow clouded and the mind unstable, to name a few negative effects."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_032,"The technique used during the past era to bind the souls of homunculi and mutants via external factors. This compelled them to follow orders and restricted their actions, thus protecting their alchemist creators from any rebellious behavior."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_033,"Generally speaking, this refers to the Aladissian Empire at the peak of its prosperity. Everything after its fall is considered to be ""modern civilization."""
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_034,The date system that has been in continuous use from the time of the past civilization through to the present day.
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_035,"A currency that is widely used in the present day. However, as the Research Team lacks merchants to buy from, most transactions are completed by bartering or trading without the use of money."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_036,"Circular pedestals found throughout Aladiss that are placed along major mana pathways. They had equipment resting atop them which has since been destroyed, leaving only the bases behind."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_037,"Small towers dotted across Aladiss. By using Flammi's power to turn on their lights, they can be used as landmarks for the investigation."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_038,"Small shrines that are occasionally found throughout Aladiss. While their exact use is unknown, the prevailing theory is that they were built to worship the abundant power of mana—which is where the current name comes from."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_039,"Structures that can occasionally be spotted around Aladiss. They generally have a large amount of items inside, so the Research Team has taken to calling them ""treasure troves"" for convenience. Their original function remains a mystery."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_040,A spot at which mana bursts forth from the earth. This phenomenon can be seen in most regions and is an excellent source of particles.
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_041,Remnants of memories born from mana. Collecting enough of these and performing Recipe Recall allows for them to be stored within a Memory Vial.
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_042,"A tool that can turn information into a stored memory. They serve as windows into the past civilization and as a way for Yumia to store synthesis recipes, among other uses."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_043,"Information on tools to be synthesized that has been condensed into a clear blueprint. Once Yumia has prepared one of these in the form of a Memory Vial, she can use it to pull up the details during synthesis."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_044,"A flower that absorbs mana from its surroundings, storing it in the form of nectar, which Yumia can use in the same way as energy."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_045,"Refers to the previous state of the pedestals which Yumia uses to clear manabound areas, before they were broken. Their original function was to regulate the circulation of mana and its density."
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_046,A term referring to some plan involving homunculi that is progressing in secret. Further details are unknown at this time.
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_047,A cocoon filled with the sealed away memories of the citizens of Aladiss. Basilius plans to use homunculi as vessels to revive the citizens.
STR_LIBRARY_GLOSSARY_048,"The name of a special Memory Vial used to collect all of Aladiss's knowledge and technology. Memory Vials constitute recipes for synthesis. With this in one's possession, the limits of what could be created would be theoretically endless."

STR_LIBRARY_CHARACTER_000,"A young woman who is a practicing alchemist. Following the hints left behind by her mother, she has joined the Aladiss Research Team to figure out the truth behind alchemy. Once she's made up her mind, absolutely nothing will stop her. On the other hand, there are many things she approaches haphazardly and completes lazily."
STR_LIBRARY_CHARACTER_001,"A young woman who is a practicing alchemist. Through her investigation of Aladiss, she has come to know various positive and negative impacts that alchemy has had on history. She is still searching for the answer as to whether the power entrusted to her is truly right, and this mission is also a journey to understand her own place in the world going forward."
STR_LIBRARY_CHARACTER_002,"A young woman who is a practicing alchemist. Having lost her memories of her mother, she was on the verge of also losing sight of the initial reason she joined the Research Team. But in the midst of it all, she had the opportunity to reflect on herself and confront the truth about alchemy. Memories are for building towards a new future. Together with her friends, Yumia took her first step towards a new tomorrow."
STR_LIBRARY_CHARACTER_003,"A member of the Order of Eustella and Isla's older brother. Despite being from an influential family, events have led to him joining the Research Team.

STR_LIBRARY_CHARACTER_004,"A member of the Order of Eustella and Isla's older brother. He volunteered to join the Research Team in order to take vengeance on Vesper, who had laid waste to his hometown. He got his chance to face Vesper, but he wasn't powerful enough and the opportunity slipped through his grasp. While carrying out his duties as a member of the Research Team, he awaits the day when they will fight once again."
STR_LIBRARY_CHARACTER_005,"A member of the Order of Eustella and Isla's older brother. He finally achieved his longstanding goal of defeating Vesper, bringing closure to his traumatic past.

STR_LIBRARY_CHARACTER_006,"A member of the Order of Eustella and Viktor's younger sister. While she wasn't originally the type to fight on the front lines, she's joined the Research Team for her own reasons. Bright and bubbly, she charms everyone she meets. She pays close attention to her surroundings, making her good at maneuvering in social situations."
STR_LIBRARY_CHARACTER_007,"A member of the Order of Eustella and Viktor's younger sister. She joined the Research Team with her brother in pursuit of Vesper, who fuels the passionate anger she usually keeps hidden away in her heart. She continues to investigate in order to defeat Vesper and find out what his goals are."
STR_LIBRARY_CHARACTER_008,"A member of the Order of Eustella and Viktor's younger sister. As they had both survived and experienced loss in the same disaster, Isla stuck close to Yumia after she lost her memories. She had been friendly with Yumia from the beginning, partly due to her naturally open personality, but now their friendship has deepened to the point where they could be considered best friends."
STR_LIBRARY_CHARACTER_009,"An adventurer who has joined the Research Team. His creed is to not be bound by others, and he does what he wants, when he wants.

STR_LIBRARY_CHARACTER_012,"A mysterious woman who used to be a mercenary. While her reliable skills helped Yumia and the others out of a serious bind, her motivation for joining the Research Team and her personal history are completely shrouded in mystery. She's unexpectedly mischievous, which only makes her thoughts all the more impenetrable."
STR_LIBRARY_CHARACTER_013,"A former mercenary who is actually a homunculus created in Aladiss. She joined the Research Team to learn about the fate of her mother and creator, Doctor Marina, after the destruction of Aladiss. Her companions expressed their willingness to accept her as she is, and so, Nina continues her mission as “the same old Nina."""
STR_LIBRARY_CHARACTER_014,"A former mercenary and homunculus born in Aladiss. During the final stages of the investigation, she found the message that Doctor Marina had left behind for her. Now able to accept herself as her own person, and not just a substitute for Marina's daughter, she keeps her mother's feelings in her heart as she faces the future."
STR_LIBRARY_CHARACTER_015,"The only Welleks on the Research Team. She may be keeping her guard up around Yumia and the others, as she keeps her distance from them. Generally jumpy and nervous, she doesn't seem to have much in the way of self-confidence."
STR_LIBRARY_CHARACTER_016,"The only Welleks on the Research Team, and a member of the Flumme clan located in Eustella.

STR_LIBRARY_CHARACTER_024,"A bipedal monster that appeared before Yumia's party. He articulately speaks the human language despite very clearly not being human. Immense power radiates from him, so it's easy to tell that he's no ordinary person, but his true identity is shrouded in mystery."
STR_LIBRARY_CHARACTER_025,"One of the mutants that appeared before Yumia's party. Although born into a prominent alchemist family, he was not blessed with talent, and after joining the military he volunteered to become a test subject for mutant experiments. As he grew up being told that his life had no value, he is determined to prove his worth and carries out his country's orders more faithfully than anyone else."
STR_LIBRARY_CHARACTER_026,"A bipedal monster that attacked Yumia and her party out of the blue. She appears to be particularly hostile towards Yumia and gives herself over to rage while she attacks. Although she is capable of communicating with humans, there is no room for conversation. Her words are filled with nothing but malice and fury."

Her words of resentment will never disappear, and they remain strongly and deeply engraved in Yumia's heart."
STR_LIBRARY_CHARACTER_028,"A bipedal monster that appeared before Yumia's party. While he is undoubtedly hostile towards the Research Team, he also seems to take great pleasure in the situation. In addition to being an imposing figure, he observes Yumia with keen eyes."

STR_LIBRARY_CHARACTER_038,"The alchemist from the past civilization who created Nina. She was one of the most talented researchers of her time, but she couldn't accept her country's policies, which led to her defecting along with her colleagues and Nina.

STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_000,How much longer do you think it will take for Eustella to reach this level of prosperity?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_001,"Longer than our lifetimes, I'm sure. We'd need to basically start learnin' mana technology from scratch."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_002,"There is also the lack of awareness surrounding alchemy, which wouldn't be a straightforward obstacle to resolve."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_003,We've seen just about everything. Let's head back to the entrance.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_004,Wilma is so ambitious! I really hope we can find some clues for her.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_005,"Agreed. But for now, our priority is finding useful information that will help our efforts in this country."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_006,I hope something turns up in our investigation ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_007,Seems like we've seen most of the place ... Let's find a place to go over what we learned here.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_008,Investigating the capital is quite the undertaking ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_009,"We're just acting as the vanguard, so let's hope that the investigation by the other members uncovers something."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_010,"Agreed. For now, let's return to base and make our report."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_011,... I don't like it. Somethin' felt off.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_012,Huh? What do you mean?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_013,Licht was actin' funny. He was really pressin' the issue ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_014,"Nah, I'm probably overthinkin' it. Forget it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_015,"(No, it's bothering me a bit too ... Does he have a personal interest in this?)"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_016,The Harvest Project really spread its roots everywhere ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_017,"Indeed, and I'm certain that we're still only scratching the surface."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_018,"In any case, should we go back and report in? Maybe someone else will have new information too."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_019,Could Licht really be scheming something? Even though he's been helping us all this time?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_020,"That's why we need to look into this. Of course, it would be best if this all turns out to have been needless concern."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_021,It seems like he's even more of a mystery than we thought ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_022,Yeah. But at least we've confirmed that he's definitely hiding something. Let's go tell the chief.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_023,"(The more I think about it, the more I realize how many things he's done that make no sense.)"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_024,"(But still, he's been really helpful to our pioneering efforts ... )"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_025,( ... Dwelling on it won't get us anywhere. What we need to do now is hurry to the water storage facility.)
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_026,"Based on his tracks, it appears that Licht was moving in the direction of the Auruma region."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_027,L-let's follow him!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_028,... What should I have said to him?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_029,I doubt anyone here would have known what to say in your position.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_030,I was frozen too ... After hearing him say that ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_031,We should report back. The chief needs to know exactly what happened.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_032,"Yumia, do you know what you're going to do?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_033,"... Yes. I don't know if it's the best option, though."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_034,"I-I believe in your judgment, Miss Yumia."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_035,I do too. I believe that the value of the lives of me and other homunculi is also concerned here.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_036,"So, on the way there, I want us to go over our thoughts together. Let's make a choice we won't regret, Yumia."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_037,... All right. Let's check in with the chief one last time. What happens next is up to Licht.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_038,"Well, if he does anythin' shady with it, we can just hunt him down."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_039,I have faith that he won't.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH04_040,Yeah. All we can do is have faith ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_000,I wonder if the Aladissian Empire had anything like a relaxation center.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_001,"They were humans too, so there's no way they didn't. Let's go check out a few places we could maybe use."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_002,"Sure enough, we're not going to find a good spot that easily."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_003,"Hmm ... Thinking about it, a relaxation center should be in a quiet place, so maybe this isn't the right area?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_004,"Licht did say there should be something ... All right, let's expand our search a little."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_005,How about we head toward Ramus Radix Station then? We might get lucky investigatin' around there.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_006,Th-those recordings really made it sound like a nice place.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_007,Yeah! I really hope it's still standing!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_008,"We've taken out a decent number. This should be good, right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_009,I think so. Let's let the Alber know.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_010,"All right, we got everything we needed. Let's bring it back to the Alber."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_011,"Hey, what should we do first?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_012,"Lodgings are a non-negotiable, right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_013,I-I agree. You can't really rest without a roof over your head and a place to lie down ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_014,A place where you can eat good grub and doze off would be the best ... But maybe that's askin' for too much.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_015,"Come to think of it, do you think the team members who visited the relaxation center were able to rest properly?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_016,I'm curious too. Let's ask the chief.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_017,"Hmm ... Okay, we've heard from a lot of people. Let's go to the relaxation center and organize what we've learned."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_018,I wonder if people have finally been able to relax after visiting the new and improved relaxation center.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_019,Maybe we should check it out! Let's go ask the chief.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_020,I'm startin' to think it'd be better to send people back to Eustella. Gettin' people to relax in Aladiss is impossible.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_021,But doing that would dwindle our already small numbers. It could even spell the end of the entire Research Team.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_022,I'll come up with something so it doesn't have to come to that. Let's go back to the relaxation center.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_023,That was really relaxing. I feel great. I just hope the rest of the team will feel the same way.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_024,Indeed. Let's give it some time and then ask the chief how people are feeling.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_025,I bet seeing people use it after all our hard work will feel great!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_026,"Definitely. It's a bit out of the way, but would you come with me?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_027,Of course! Let's go see how it's going!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_028,"Wow, my body feels so light. It's like my fatigue is completely gone!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_029,"Yeah, it feels like a heavy weight's been lifted off my shoulders. To think it works so quickly."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_030,Does this mean everyone will enjoy the center even more than before?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_031,"There's no way they wouldn't. If this doesn't do it, we'll have to send people back to Eustella to be hospitalized."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH03_032,"... That said, we should report back before we forget."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_000,This sounds like it's gonna be a borin' one. I'm more a fan of the rough-and-tumble missions.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_001,Basic investigations like this are the main purpose of the team!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_002,I hope we can find something helpful at Hermea Academy.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_003,"We don't have any other leads, so givin' it a shot can't hurt."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_004,"If that's all we need, I can have it ready in no time at all. Let's get this to Wilma quickly."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_005,That Wilma sure is a hard worker.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_006,"She really is. It seems this has all been the plan for a while now, too. It makes things simpler though, so I'm all for it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_007,"Agreed. For starters, I think we should get to work on fixing some of the buildings that are in dire need of repairs."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_008,"We've fixed up a lot ... This should be good, right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_009,I'd like to think so. Let's go talk to Wilma.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_010,Let's report what we learned to Wilma. Hopefully it will help our investigation move forward ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_011,Things are over for you if even the Alber are worried about you. But I wonder what got them so frustrated.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_012,I'm sure they never imagined that their complaints would be preserved for hundreds of years.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_013,"The Harvest Project ... Sounds like it was real, but it didn't go well."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_014,S-so angry ... Just what kind of experiment was it?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_015,So many memories of stressed people ... I feel exhausted ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_016,"Well, let's go tell Wilma about this for now."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_017,We don't always find the information we hope for. It happens.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_018,All that's left is to report back to the chief. Let's tell him what we found.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_019,Yes. That's the best we can do.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_020,I think we should plant some trees then. Maybe around the Alber settlement would be good.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_021,"Yeah, that area doesn't have much green at all. Good idea!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_022,"Okay, I think this should be good for now."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_023,"Yes, we shouldn't overdo it. This will be a group initiative, after all."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_024,"Right. Now, time to go report back."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_025,But what're we supposed to do for a food project?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_026,We should build a storehouse where food can be kept long-term. We can raise awareness on the importance of having reserves.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_027,"I see. In that case, let's build it in the Silva settlement. We should focus on the prosperity of the local people first."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_028,"The storehouse is complete, so let's go report to the chief."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_029,But how do we cultivate wisdom? We can't just stuff knowledge into everyone's heads.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_030,How about renovating one of the ruins in the base? You can't cultivate knowledge without having a place to learn.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_031,Good idea. Let's look for some ruins that seem fixable.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_032,"The ruin repairs are done, so let's go report to the chief."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH02_033,I hope this new Harvest Project we thought up will spread to everyone.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_000,"Wilma the scholar, huh? I wonder what kind of person she is. Come to think of it, I forgot to ask for any details."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_001,We'll just have to ask once we get there.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_002,I wonder if we'll spot something if we look out from the top?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_003,This tower is awfully interesting. Let's look around while we climb up.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_004,Voices coming from an underground lake ... Which means that there's a cave or something underneath it?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_005,"It's not like this could actually be a ghost story, right?!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_006,"Shouldn't we hope that it's spirits? Ah, though I guess the issue is whether or not spirits actually exist ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_007,S-so it could be ghosts?!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_008,The fastest way to find out is to go check for ourselves.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_009,"Still a lotta unexplored areas out there, huh."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_010,"If there weren't, then our investigation would be over."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_011,I know. Let a guy make a comment.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_012,I can't help but wonder about this place.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_013,Is this really the village we were looking for?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_014,"We don't have much to go off of yet, but it certainly feels significant. Let's go report back for now."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_015,"Now then, where to look first?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_016,"Regardless of where we look, the first order of business will have to be clearing out the debris."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_017,Of course we gotta do manual labor ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_018,"All right, let's get to it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_019,Let's go report back to the chief!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_020,I wonder if there's any news about the Village That Lives with Spirits.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_021,The chief might have received a report about it. Why don't we head back to the base for a bit?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_022,M-Miss Yumia ... Cheer up.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_023,Sorry to darken the mood.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_024,"This may not be all that convincing, but you're nothing like the alchemists from that village, Yumia."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_025,I wonder what ever happened with that fishing village.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_026,The investigation was halted once we learned the truth about the village. Should we go ask about it?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_027,I think so. Let's go see the chief.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_028,"Oh yeah, wasn't there a house with a library in it?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_029,"Yes, but I believe we've already looked through there."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_030,"Ah, I get what you mean."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_031,What does he mean?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_032,"Before we were looking into the village's secret, but now we're pioneering. The information we want has changed."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_033,Now the mana should flow to the village properly. I wonder if anything will be different now.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_034,Let's take a look around and check.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_035,We can finally take a breather now.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_036,I'm glad that place seems like it will be a good base for the Research Team!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_RICH01_037,"It'll take some time before it's a proper base, though. We should visit it again later."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_000,"If all the clues to unraveling the past have been erased, our investigation is going to be much more difficult."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_001,Maybe it all got buried?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_002,That's wishful thinkin'.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_003,"Well then, why don't you tell us what you think happened?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_004,"Either everythin' really was wiped out, or ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_005,"Nah, there's no point in speculatin'. We'd better just look around."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_006,"Do you think it's really the same world beyond that wall? Maybe it's a whole other world, like in a fairy tale ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_007,Dunno if it's anythin' that far-fetched.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_008,"Assuming it really was Basilius's doing, perhaps he put the wall up to prevent anyone from interfering with his plan."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_009,"In other words, maybe we'll find something he wants to keep hidden inside."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_010,"This city's pretty weird, though. People really used to live in a place like this?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_011,"Not exactly. I mean, in terms of location, yes, they lived here, but ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_012,"Miss Nina, you seem to have had something on your mind for a while now ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_013,"I'm sure that as our investigation progresses, it will become clearer how the city came to be the way it is."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_014,The mana here is very dense. We need to make sure that we don't run out of energy while investigating.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_015,"Yes, I'm sensing quite a lot of mana, especially in the direction of the laboratory."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_016,Yeah. I guess there really is something in there.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_017,Why does the flow of mana go all the way out here ...?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_018,"Yeah, it's almost like someone is forcibly bringing it out here."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_019,Kinda like bringin' water out to a field to irrigate it?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_020,"Yeah, that's a good way of putting it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_021,"I hate graves. I keep thinking something's going to jump out ... Not just monsters, but something else too!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_022,Somethin' else? What do you mean by somethin' else?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_023,"Well, you know ... A bunch of things ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_024,"They went to so much trouble to hide it—there's gotta be somethin' valuable, right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_025,"Hey, stop that! You sound like a grave robber!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_026,"What're you sayin'? We've already forced our way in, so it's too late for that!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_027,"You said you lived there for only a short while, but how short was it?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_028,"Very. I didn't have the freedom to walk around, so the doctor arranged a place for us to stay for a few weeks."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_029,A few weeks ... But you still remember it clearly.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_030,"Yes, so clearly it surprises even me."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_031,Was this building restored using alchemy too?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_032,"I don't know what else it could be. But isn't this overdoing it, even for alchemy?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_033,"Yeah, something like this would be impossible for me ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_034,Is there something further in here?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_035,"There could be. If there is, it's up to us as the Research Team to find it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_036,You're right. We need to be brave and keep going.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_037,"As I thought, their technology is leagues above mine."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_038,But I have to do what I can. Time to return to the commercial district's mana control tower.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_039,What kind of place is a judicial office?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_040,"The headquarters for judicial business. In other words, it's probably where people were put on trial."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_041,The crimes of the past may end up being very useful information in the present.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_042,Okay. Let's make sure we find something!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_043,"A sage, hm? What could that possibly mean?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_044,They could've made it a little easier to understand!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_045,"Still, any lead is better than no lead. Let's search the council building for this ""sage."""
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_046,It's an underground path. I can't believe there's something like this here.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_047,"Ugh, it's disgustin' down here. Let's get through quick."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_048,"Agh, the water's getting in my shoes!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_049,Bear with it.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_050,"Gah! It smells all moldy here, too! This is the worst!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_051,Everything looks very old. This passage might be the same as it was before Aladiss fell.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_052,You're right ... It feels very different down here compared to the buildings outside.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_053,"If we keep searching, we may find more areas like this."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_054,This is takin' a while. An exit would be nice.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_055,Seriously! It's even more humid down here than it was in Sivash. I just wanna get out of here!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_056,"And with that, we've successfully gained control over all three towers."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_057,"Before we go to the laboratory, we should return back to base and report in."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_058,Good idea. I get the feeling that it won't be easy for us to turn back once we start down this path ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_059,Let's make sure we all rest up so everything goes without a hitch!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_060,The 1st Imperial Laboratory. Home to the most advanced alchemical research.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_061,Indeed. One could call it the true heart of Aladiss.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_062,We need to be more careful than ever!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_063,"Okay, one down."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_064,"Two left, then. This laboratory is like a maze. Everyone, make sure you don't get separated from the group."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_065,There's something fishy about it. I hope nothing weird happens.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_066,We've already found two control authorizations!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_067,Just one left. Things are going well.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_068,"Yeah, it's been pretty smooth ... Too smooth."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_069,All three control authorizations have been acquired. Preparations to operate the central device are now complete.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN04_070,All right. Let's make our way back.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_000,H-how can something so big not leave any records?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_001,Records about Aladiss have always been vague. That's exactly why our investigations have so much to teach us.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_002,"So, the things we discover could be written about in history books one day?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_003,It's very possible.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_004,W-wow! We'd better not disappoint then ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_005,The Geni are so kind. I'm surprised.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_006,Do you think they're completely different from the Neru?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_007,"I'm not sure yet. They do share a lot of similarities, though ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_008,This could still be a trap. Don't let your guard down.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_009,"Between their culture and their connection with Corleonis, there's still so much we don't know."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_010,"Fortunately, they seem to be quite friendly towards humans, so let's ask around."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_011,I don't know if they're friendly or just fascinated because we're a rare sight around these parts ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_012,"""To restore Aladiss"" ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_013,Nina?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_014,"Oh, sorry. I was just recalling what Corleonis said."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_015,I was wondering if it's somehow connected to why he's collecting particles.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_016,I see. I'll think on that a bit too.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_017,"If we find any leads at the station, it might bring us closer to an answer."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_018,Maybe someone will find a lead while we're resting!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_019,"Corleonis is definitely aware of the Research Team, so we might run into him again somewhere."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_020,Corleonis ... I really wonder what his aim is ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_021,Let's return to base for now. We can think about it while we rest.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_022,Stirium ... I've never heard of it before.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_023,You think it's unique to Aladiss? That would mean it could be worth a good price ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_024,Rutger. Don't forget why we're here.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_025,"I know, I know. I won't get in the way of the mission."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_026,You done with your pointless bickering?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_027,"We're done, we're done."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_028,"Anyway, I'm glad we got the Stirium. Now all that's left is to repair the core."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_029,"Okay, that should do it!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_030,Thanks to Flammi's assist—
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_031,"Yeah, yeah."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_032,Let's head back to the Mana Transposing Furnace and continue with the repairs.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_033,(How could Nina be created through alchemy? She looks no different from any of us ... )
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_034,(I just can't wrap my head around this. There's no point in thinking about it now.)
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_035,(Let's return to the Auruma survey base and listen to Nina's story together with the chief.)
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_036,"Hey, Flammi. What do you think we should do next?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_037,Flammi believes that it is necessary to exchange thoughts with the others regarding Nina.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_038,"Flammi also recommends investigating the commercial district, but the decision is yours to make, Yumia."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_039,"Right, thanks. Your levelheaded answers are exactly what I need right now."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_040,I'm glad I got to learn more about Nina and Doctor Marina.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_041,Although I'm sure there are still many more memories that belong to just the two of them.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_042,The Great Tree of Latere ... You have a point. What exactly was Nina doing back then?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_043,"Dunno, but I get the feelin' it wasn't just part of the investigation."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_044,A necklace passed down by the Flumme clan ... I'll check in with you as I make it to make sure it looks right.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_045,"I-if there's anything I can do to help, let me know!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_046,Thanks! I'm sure I'll need the help.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_047,I'm glad I talked to everyone. I feel like we've been able to sort out our feelings a little bit.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_048,I really should have a proper talk with Nina too. I wonder where she is.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_049,So the Ligneus region was your last memory of the past civilization?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_050,Yes. Although that giant tree was never there before.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_051,"Even if it's been engulfed by the trees, there might still be some leads left. Let's get going."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_052,A station ... Were there a lot of stations in the past?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_053,Yes. They were hubs for incredibly fast vehicles that were crucial for transportation.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_054,Whoa. I'd love to ride one someday.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_055,Let's follow Flammi's route and look for a way to enter the central shaft.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_056,Most paths were likely crushed during the collapse.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_057,Flammi will search for the paths that have the highest probability of still being intact.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_058,"There are many issues to address, but first and foremost, let's inform the chief that you've recovered."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_059,Right. Let's head to the survey base.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_060,"Don't push yourself too hard, Miss Yumia."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_061,Don't worry. I'm fine ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_062,You think Yumia is really all right?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_063,"Fallin' from that height and just brushin' it off? That alone is bizarre, if you ask me."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_064,"I hope Miss Yumia is all right, but I guess she really isn't ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_065,Is there really nothing we can do?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_066,Dunno. Let's just go back to the atelier for now.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_067,Let's head back to the Auruma survey base. It's time to settle the score with Corleonis!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_068,We should go over everything that's happened so far. Let's get together and make sure we're all on the same page.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_069,All ready to fire! Let's head back to the top of the tree.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_070,Corleonis ... Everyone make sure you're as ready as you can be.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_071,The sealed chamber. Who would've thought.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN03_072,Let's get back as soon as we can! This is so exciting!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_000,"Manabound areas ... Er, ""forbidden lands,"" was it? Why would they choose to live in a place like this?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_001,There must be some reason ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_002,Our first priority is taking care of the manabound area. We need to show them that Yumia's power is real.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_003,Who could it be?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_004,"No idea, but if she fixes this mess, then I'm all for it. Let's go to the meetin' point."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_005,A mediator ... Could he have been talking about her?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_006,We're so lucky that there's a Welleks on the Research Team.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_007,I dunno if I'm as optimistic after meetin' her in person.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_008,"Well, the chief will be with her, so I'm sure it'll be fine. Let's all go back to the Welleks settlement."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_009,Nina being with us really puts my heart at ease.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_010,*Chuckle* I'll try my best not to cause any problems.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_011,"We'll put you to work right away. ... Though, the first thing we gotta do is those chores."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_012,Let's go talk to the people in the settlement and see if there's anything we can help them with.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_013,"Clearing out the monsters on the path to the cathedral, huh? Let's head over once we're done preparing."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_014,"That reminds me, Nina. I have a lot to tell you about tools and such."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_015,That was close ... I almost said something I shouldn't have.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_016,"Be more careful, seriously."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_017,I know ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_018,I've got to pull myself together ... Okay. Let's collect the ingredients we need while putting a recipe together.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_019,"All right, they're done. Now to deliver them to the Welleks."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_020,"The Neru ... If they really are monsters that can speak, the chances that Vesper's involved are high."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_021,... Yeah. Let's go hear what the Welleks have to say. We may get closer to finding out who that monster really is.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_022,Hermea Academy ... It's just south of here.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_023,"Move it, people!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_024,And to think he tried to get out of helping earlier ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_025,I might be able to work with this ... I'll start my preparations.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_026,"Okay, it's finished! This turned out pretty all right."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_027,It is thanks to Flammi's assistance.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_028,"I know, I know. Thank you, Flammi."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_029,"Now then, let's get back to the repairs. Then all that's left is to pray it moves ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_030,We've gone around helping a lot of people. That should be enough for now.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_031,Although I feel a little unsure about whether we actually gained the trust of the Welleks or not ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_032,Isn't that just how things always are at the start? They won't warm up to us just like that.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_033,"You're right. Well, let's go to the new research base. We have to give our report."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_034,"First she leads those monsters to us, and now she goes missin' ... What's goin' on with her?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_035,Maybe something bad happened ...?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_036,"In any case, let's go to the settlement and ask around."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_037,"Putting together a recipe, synthesizing ... I've got to hurry."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_038,Making a mistake because you're rushing won't help the situation. It's best to stay calm at times like this.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_039,"Okay, it's done! Time to test it!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_040,"Our one trace of Lenja's whereabouts was in the southern part of the settlement, so we should try it out there."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_041,"What was she tryin' to do, wanderin' around like this? That's not somethin' you do if you're in danger."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_042,Did she go alone? That's even more concerning ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_043,"Thinking back on it, the first time we met her, she had a group of monsters on her tail ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_044,*Sigh* Guess we're cleanin' up her mess again. Gimme a break. This is not what I signed up for.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_045,"I understand how you feel, but we're on the same team. We have to help one another."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_046,I'm waitin' with bated breath for the day she's any help to us in return.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_047,"Lenja's from a different group than the Silva who live here, right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_048,"I believe so. I heard she signed up for the Research Team all by herself, too."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_049,Even though she seems younger than me. Impressive.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_050,I wonder why she joined.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_051,The Welleks originally come from Aladiss. I can imagine she has some interest in researching this place.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_052,But by herself? Did she not have any friends from her hometown who wanted to come along?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_053,Are you sure this is the right way?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_054,"While Yumia may make mistakes, Flammi does not."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_055,"Is it so hard to just say ""yes""?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_056,Yes.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_057,... I see.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_058,Say ... Don't you think it'd be better to make a few more adjustments to that thing?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_059,"I know! I do, sometimes! And this is how it's ended up!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_060,It seems like she went to the Neru settlement after all ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_061,Then we should go ask them directly.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_062,"The Neru settlement ... Apart from their conflict with the Welleks, I haven't heard of them being dangerous, but ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_063,"I wonder if it'll be okay. They won't just jump out and attack us, will they?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_064,"There haven't been any reports like that from the other team members, so it should be fine ... But let's be careful."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_065,"""Bring back as much Alstahlia as you can carry"" ... Did the Neru demand that because it's impossible?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_066,"It's likely. But Lenja bears no grudge towards the Neru, and the manabound area has been cleared."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_067,She probably took the condition at face value and followed it without questioning.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_068,There's a lot of layers to this incident ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_069,I hope that she's okay.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_070,She said that the Welleks and Neru can understand each other ... Is Lenja trying to be a mediator for them as well?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_071,Tch. She's wastin' her time meddlin' with stuff she knows nothin' about.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_072,"I understand how she feels, though. I think we're quite alike."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_073,"""Stuff she knows nothing about,"" huh? That may be true."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_074,... There's such a thing as bein' too good-natured.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_075,"I know I'm repeatin' myself, but is this really the right—"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_076,"It is, okay? We made it to the Neru settlement, so we know it's working"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_077,So that klutz was actually zigzagging around like this?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_078,She must have been searching all over for Alstahlia.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_079,"Yumia, are you feeling okay?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_080,"Yeah. After getting some rest, I think I'm good now. But I'd like to go back to the base for a bit ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_081,"The Welleks live here, so they might know something about that monster."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_082,They sure seem fine despite her rampaging around.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_083,Or maybe she doesn't attack them?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_084,"I wonder. For now, let's just talk to Cledia."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_085,The Neru settlement ... I wonder if they'll have more conditions for us to enter ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_086,"It'll be okay. We're with you this time, so I'm sure we can find a way."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_087,"Y-you're right. Yeah, it'll be okay ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_088,An Energy Generator should be enough to satisfy the Neru.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_089,"All right, let's get back to base!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_090,I wonder what's recorded inside ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_091,There's so much going through my head that I can't sort my thoughts out. Let me rest in the tent for a bit ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_092,Miss Yumia ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_093,Don't worry. I'm sure I'll feel better after I sleep a bit.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_094,"Should we go straight after Lili Borea, or should we go investigate the observatory?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_095,W-we'll leave it to Miss Yumia to decide!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_096,"Yeah. Thanks, everyone."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_097,I don't think there's anything else to look at in the observatory.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_098,Yeah. It's time we get back on the trail of Lili Borea.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_099,I wonder if that monster from earlier is still watching us.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_100,"Maybe. It's unnerving to think about, but as long as he keeps his distance, we should be fine."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_101,I wish he'd stop following us already ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_102,We can use the Great Elevator one more time and go further east.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_103,... Was there a path to the east over there?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_104,L-let's go check again!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_105,"I'm not skilled enough to duplicate the Energy Core, but if all we need is a temporary container ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_106,"Flammi, can you help me come up with a recipe?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_107,Of course. Leave it to Flammi.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN02_108,"Okay, it's done! Let's go back to the control unit and use it!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_006,"I hope we get along, Yumia!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_007,Y-yeah. Me too.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_008,"(Okay, I should gather some ingredients as we make our way to the atelier.)"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_009,We're almost there.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_010,"So this is the perfect place for alchemy, huh?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_011,"That's right, nowhere else comes close. I think that maybe another alchemist used it in the past."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_012,Alchemy sure requires a lot of preparation.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_013,Yes. Things don't go well if the working environment isn't set up properly ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_014,"I don't really understand, but I'll do my best to help with whatever is necessary."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_015,"Anyways, let's try out that tool from earlier on a nearby monster."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_016,"It won't suddenly explode on us or anything, will it?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_017,"It won't! ... At least, not this one."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_018,He's certainly intense.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_019,"He's a strict man, and no fan of using alchemy."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_020,"Okay ... So for medicine, maybe something like ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_021,"We're counting on you, doctor."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_022,"N-no, I'm just ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_023,I guess we're done helping out here for now.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_024,"Yeah, we should head back to the base."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_025,I'll need some ingredients to make it the way I'm imagining it. Let's go look for them.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_026,"All right, let's head back to the atelier. I hope my ideas come together nicely ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_027,So far so good. Next is to use this for synthesis.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_028,"If I can keep learning how to make more and more things, I'm sure I'll be able to be helpful to everyone."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_029,"Yumia, if you're all ready, let's go to the lighthouse."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_030,Show us how you can clear the manabound area.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_031,"With this, we can expand our exploration range just like that!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_032,"Well then, where to investigate next?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_033,Let's head back to base and talk it over.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_034,"Where to go, north or east ...?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_035,"We'll leave it to you, Yumia!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_036,"You're the only one who can clear the path for us, after all."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_037,Did something happen inside the forest?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_038,We're not exactly exploration experts ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_039,We just need to be careful and look around where we can.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_040,"Once we're done investigating, we should go report back to the chief."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_041,I think it might be good to investigate to the east before heading back. There could be some clues that way.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_042,"Yumia, you can sense the flow of mana around you, right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_043,"Well, I can sense the general direction at least."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_044,I see. I want to see what that's like too ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_045,I wonder if I still have some Repair Kits ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_046,"The place is named the Margo Central Observation Station, and it seems alchemists once worked there."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_047,What's going to happen this time ...?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_048,"It may be ruins, but it's still a place connected to alchemists. We can't let our guard down."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_049,Let's return to base. We need to ask some questions.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_050,You still feeling a little bashful there?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_051,"Quiet, you. I just feel a little weird after talking about that. I never told anyone before."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_052,He's a prickly guy. Not a fan.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_053,That's a surprise. You're normally all smiles with anyone you come across.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_054,"Hmm, well, I try to be nice."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_055,*Sigh* I sure have gotten myself wrapped up in somethin' weird ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_056,"We're all part of the same team anyway, so it's best to just accept it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_057,"Yeah ... Wait, why are you sympathizin' with me?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_058,"Well, I'm also caught up in some pretty weird stuff ... Anyways, come on. Let's go to the atelier."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_059,"All right, so he uses a ... scythe? Hmm, how should I make this?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_060,He has quite the peculiar taste in weaponry.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_061,I'm sure you're the last person he'd want to hear that from.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_062,"So, there's an Alber settlement located somewhere inside the dense northern woodland."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_063,We'll head into the forest. Maybe I'll get a chance to try out this new weapon soon.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_064,"I just made it, so please take care of it, okay?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_065,"They're doing us a favor too, so let's help them out! Let's hurry and fix that fence."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_066,"What, now you're a master carpenter?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_067,Not at all.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_068,It feels good to make something that's helpful to others.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_069,"Thanks to you too, Rutger. You got us here without a hitch."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_070,... I'm sure you would've figured it out on your own with a little diggin'.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_071,"C'mon, just take the compliment."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_072,Tch ... Let's hurry up and get moving.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_073,There's something I want to try making. Could I ask for your help?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_074,You figured out a way to get those roots outta the way?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_075,Yes ... Maybe. Probably.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_076,"Wow, I can really feel the confidence. Whatever, if you have an idea, let's get to it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_077,Yeesh. That was a rough time.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_078,If Nina hadn't shown up ...<CR>I'll probably never forget that moment.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_079,I'd heard that Chief Erhard had gathered some highly-skilled adventurers. I should have expected nothing less.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_080,Let's go back to the survey base. We need to speak with the chief.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_MAIN01_081,"Yeah, walkin' around tired puts us at risk even against the small fries."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA04_000,"When we're just fighting together normally, it's not that easy to keep an eye on anything other than the opponent."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA04_001,You can say that again. Actually getting a good look at how you fight might be a rare opportunity.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA04_002,"Knowing that I'm being watched makes me nervous.<CR>In any case, shall we take on some nearby monsters?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA04_003,"All right, bullets for Nina ... I can't just throw them together like I would my own bullets."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA04_004,I'd better prepare a proper recipe and do this right.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA04_005,"I'll need a desk and some chairs. Oh, and a basket too ... What else?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA04_006,*Chuckle* You certainly are taking this seriously.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA04_007,"I sure am. This is a rare opportunity, so I want to do it right."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA04_008,"Hmm, how many kits will she need?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA04_009,"Well, I'll just give her a lot. You can never have too many!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA03_000,Something I'm capable of doing ... That doesn't leave many options.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA03_001,"But no matter how small it is, it's better than doing nothing."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA03_002,"""Extra secure,"" huh? I feel like it'd be better to leave the relics with the Research Team ... But I guess I'll do it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA03_003,A shelf ... What kind of shelf would be good?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA03_004,"Huh? As long as it can hold stuff, anything'll do."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA03_005,If you say so.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA02_000,"Let's prepare some cloth. With a little alchemy, I should be able to get it ready in no time."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA02_001,"That's right, we were talking about gathering some hides. Let me help out with that."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA02_002,"A rest area, huh? It seems like we'll need plenty of different materials, so I'd better start preparing."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA02_003,"Scales, huh? Isla really does use all sorts of materials."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA02_004,... This might be useful for my alchemy too. Let's go get them.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA02_005,Moonlit Berries? I wonder if I have any on hand.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA01_000,A whole day in the lower layer ...? I hope he's okay ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA01_001,"(He's not wrong, but maybe he should scale the heroics back a little.)"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA01_002,There! I'll just bring this to Viktor.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA01_003,"Still, I didn't realize how much you struggled with that sort of thing. I'll lend a hand the next time you're in a bind."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA01_004,"Bandages, huh? About twenty average bandages ought to do the trick."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA01_005,"There, that should be plenty. Let's go bring them to the chief."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_CHARA01_006,"(It sounds like they've been through a lot, even aside from the mana disaster. It's no wonder Viktor puts so much trust in him.)"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_000,That should do it!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_001,Nice spot.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_002,And that's that.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_003,"All right, let's keep this up!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_004,"That's it, right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_005,This could make a good landmark!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_006,"If we're done here, let's get going."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_007,Why don't we use this as a landmark for when we come back?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_008,"Let's keep this up, shall we?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_009,Seems simple enough.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_010,Th-that was okay ... right?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_011,"Phew, that's one down ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_012,The manabound area cleared up nicely! How many do you think are left in the Ligneus region?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_013,I wonder ... Maybe two or three? We'll have to look for them as well.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_014,So there are places where the flow of mana comes to an end ... We'll have to stay diligent in our investigation.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_015,We don't have many options here. The only thing we can really do is follow each mana pathway one by one.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_016,"I can't believe the pedestal is part of monster territory ... If there are a lot of places like this, it might be trouble."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_017,"People haven't set foot in them for a long time, so it might be better to assume that most places are like that."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_018,Do you think this place was used for some kind of ceremony?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_019,"No idea, but it sure is big."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_020,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_021,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_022,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_023,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_024,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_025,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_026,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_027,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_028,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_029,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_030,It seems this was a central location for the religious beliefs of the time.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_031,I wonder if lots of people visited this place in the past ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_032,What kinds of classes do you think the kids from back then took?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_033,"Not only math and history, but probably alchemy too ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_034,"I like looking at the stars too, but what exactly were they trying to study with such a large facility?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_035,"The stars are connected to more than you might think, but who knows how important they were in this country."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_036,I can't believe they needed such a huge water storage facility. Just how many people did this supply water to?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_037,"I bet it was vital not only to people's daily lives, but also to all sorts of things we can't even imagine."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_038,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_039,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_040,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_041,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_042,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_043,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_044,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_045,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_046,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_047,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_048,Seems like there used to be a lot of shops here. What in the world did they sell?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_049,"There's no way for us modern folk to even guess. But at the very least, they must've been rich."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_050,What is this facility? C-could it be some kind of store?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_051,I don't get the feeling they were selling things here ... But it sure is a huge building.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_052,"A Mana Transposing Furnace ... Aladiss sure did some big things with mana, huh."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_053,"Yeah. In Eustella, the only mana that can be used is what's already there."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_054,I think this might've been a tourist spot slightly removed from the city. I bet it was crowded with people back then.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_055,Yeah ... I'm sure the view was much more beautiful then than it is now.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_056,To think there'd be an Alber settlement in a place like this. They've come quite a long way.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_057,"Mining, making statues ... The Alber have all sorts of different livelihoods."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_058,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_059,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_060,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_061,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_062,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_063,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_064,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_065,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_066,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_067,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_068,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_069,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_070,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_071,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_072,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_073,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_074,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_075,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_076,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_077,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_078,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_079,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_080,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_081,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_082,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_083,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_084,"There's a lot of wood we could gather, but it feels kind of wrong taking from something so grand."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_085,But there are spots where it's swallowing up the ruins. It wouldn't hurt to trim it back a bit.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_086,"If we made some kinda watchtower or observation point on top of this tree, we'd be able to see pretty far, right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_087,True ... But there would be the problem of having to climb all the way up and down to use it each time.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_088,This tree really is huge. I wonder how old it is.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_089,"If it's been around since Aladiss was destroyed, very. There's a way to check, I think ... But I can't remember ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_090,It's impressive that a structure like this is still standing. Being hit by the sea breeze should have worn it down.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_091,Did it just happen to survive? Or maybe it's made of special materials created with alchemy.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_092,The ocean breeze feels nice. But I am a little uneasy about my footing ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_093,The lighthouse has made it up till now without topplin' over. I don't think it'll go down that easily.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_094,The fact that there's a lighthouse here means that Aladiss must have had relations with foreign countries ... right?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_095,It may be more accurate to say they wanted to keep an eye on them.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_096,"There's so much nature in this area, but there are also places where giant buildings are left standing."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_097,All this wide-open land might have actually been the reason they built structures this big here.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_098,I wonder if this facility will be restored and once again be able to grow crops after pioneering efforts progress.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_099,"I don't think it will be usable as is, but it might be put to use in some other way."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_100,Looks like plants were studied here. I wonder if they're any that're unique to Aladiss.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_101,I heard that a Research Team member who specializes in plant research is coming. We might be able to ask them.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_102,I'm sure this used to be an amazing botanical garden ... I would've liked to see it.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_103,Duerer doesn't have anything as nice as this place. I'm a little jealous.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_104,Was this just a normal garden? Or was it for some kinda research?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_105,"Well, given that it's in Aladiss, it could be related to alchemy in some way."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_106,"You look relaxed, Lenja."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_107,The air here is so calming ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_108,It feels so nice here. It's the perfect place to get some rest and relaxation in.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_109,"Agreed. Once all of the surveying and pioneering work is done, I could see it being used as a tourist destination."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_110,"I want a house with a view like this! You do too, right, Lenja?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_111,I think that would be wonderful. I would look forward to seeing the view from my window every morning.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_112,"This place seems valuable from a historical perspective and all, but we can't take a whole building back with us."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_113,... What are you talking about?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_114,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_115,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_116,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_117,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_118,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_119,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_120,"Hey, Yumia, do you think you can make a building this big back in Duerer?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_121,"By myself, no ... Though it might be possible with a large enough group of alchemists."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_122,How many years do you think it will take before Eustella is able to make huge buildings like this?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_123,"I-I don't know ... But if that means Eustella becomes like Aladiss, I'd be a little worried ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_124,"It's puzzling how, despite being able to make things like this, Aladiss died out, but Eustella remained."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_125,Everything has a limit. I'm sure Aladiss was no different.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_126,Hmm ... I'm not seein' anythin' that'll go for good money.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_127,Don't say stuff that might get you divinely punished!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_128,"S-since we're here, I think I'll pray for us to be allowed to investigate ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_129,"Allow me to join you. As outsiders, we should do what we can to be respectful."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_130,"Did humans create this cathedral, or did Silva from long ago?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_131,"Whoever it was, I think it's amazing how it remains so majestic to this day."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_132,"All things considered, this was quite a large school."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_133,I'm sure a bunch of rich kids went here. But now it's just a plain old ruin.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_134,An academy ... Did they have school uniforms? I want to try wearing one someday ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_135,Lenja in a school uniform? That's good ... Very good.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_136,"It's too late now, but being classmates with you back in school would've been so fun, Yumia!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_137,I feel like approaching the daughter of Duerer nobility would've been tough ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_138,"Stars, huh ... I used to love gazing up at them. I don't have the time for that nowadays, though."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_139,"Let's do our best to ensure this investigation is a success, Viktor. Then you'll have plenty of time for stargazing."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_140,"I don't know a lot about it, but I've heard that there are cultures that offer prayers to the stars."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_141,"There are a lot of cultures we don't know about, even aside from Aladiss."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_142,I heard somewhere that the light that comes from stars is actually very old. Do you think that could be true?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_143,You sure that wasn't from a fairy tale or somethin'? There's no such thing as old or new light.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_144,This place seems to utilize water resources. I think the Research Team could make good use of it.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_145,A water storage facility that has been going for hundreds of years and hasn't run dry. It may prove invaluable.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_146,The water here is really cold ... Just getting close to it makes me feel chilly.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_147,That means it's being pumped from really deep underground. In Duerer we just have wells ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_148,Was water supplied to all the nearby areas from here? You don't see facilities of this scale in Eustella very often.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_149,"Judging from the size, it must be able to provide water for all of Ligneus ... No, maybe even farther."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_150,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_151,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_152,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_153,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_154,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_155,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_156,It amazes me every time I see it. This Per ... Peli? Pelgrif? Uh ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_157,... That old man picked the worst name possible.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_158,The buildings in Aladiss are all so much larger than anything in Eustella.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_159,"Not just the buildings, but the plants too. I feel like when I get back to Eustella, everything will look tiny."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_160,"It's incredible that this giant thing can move ... Even after seeing it, I still can't believe it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_161,"Maybe it was made with the specific intention of having a large, imposing presence."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_162,Did there used to be a lot of shops in Aladiss that sold alchemy-related tools?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_163,"It's likely. Alchemy can make tools that help with daily life, so they were probably quite important."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_164,Where're the shops that sold alchemically engineered weapons? Maybe there's somethin' left behind.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_165,"I'm sure that there were weapon shops, but I doubt they sold anything as dangerous as what you're talking about."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_166,So there were many shops all in this one huge facility. Finding the store you were looking for seems difficult.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_167,Y-yeah ... I'd definitely get lost ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_168,Anyone know what this place was supposed to even be? I don't get it.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_169,It must be something well beyond our imaginations. The wreckage nearby may be our only key to figuring it out.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_170,This building has three levels. That seems to be common in the Auruma region.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_171,"It looks like a lot of people lived here, so maybe they wanted to use space efficiently?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_172,"The roads lead out from here, which makes me think this was a central facility for the region."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_173,This might be a sign that we're close to the capital. Even the ruins are starting to take on a city-like arrangement.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_174,It seems this facility handles mana ... We should pay extra close attention to the mana density here.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_175,D-don't worry! Miss Yumia and I will warn you of any dangerous areas!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_176,"Compared to the dilapidated area around it, the center is still in pretty good shape."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_177,"That must mean this was a very important facility, so a lot of care went into its design and construction."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_178,The city that once prospered thanks to mana and technology is now just a shadow of its former self.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_179,I'm sure the people who lived here never even dreamed that things would turn out like this.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_180,"Wow, the ocean breeze feels so nice!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_181,It does. But I could do without the sand blowing in with it.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_182,"It looks like this used to be a busy shopping area, too, though on a smaller scale than the city."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_183,Auruma seems to have been pretty well developed. There are places like this peppered all over the region.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_184,"When I come here, I feel like I can somehow recall what it must've looked like in the past."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_185,I think I understand what you mean. I wonder if there were gift shops and such here too.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_186,I think this is the most Alber I've seen living in a settlement since we started the investigation.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_187,I'm sure it was built up over the years as they gained more and more friends.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_188,This place has such a nice atmosphere. I feel so relaxed ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_189,The Alber here are pretty easygoing too. It really gives the sense that you're surrounded by peaceful nature.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_190,I feel like time really drifts by slowly when we're here ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_191,"Hey, don't get too comfortable! ... Well, I guess it's okay to take it easy sometimes."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_192,"The administrative district ... In other words, this is where they decided the country's policies and whatnot?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_193,Maybe. It does feel like we've reached the heart of Aladiss.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_194,I wonder if I'll have to start learning about government and stuff like that too someday.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_195,"You're really smart, so I'm sure that you'll be great at it!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_196,"Basilius wants to revive this entire giant city? He's an arrogant bastard, if you ask me."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_197,He probably doesn't want to lose even a single thing he once had ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_198,There's a lot of nature left here compared to the other areas. It makes it feel a lot calmer.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_199,I guess they wanted the souls of the people who lie here to rest in peace.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_200,"All of the graves and stuff here are things that were restored, right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_201,I guess so ... But I feel like the significance of the graves has been lost.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_202,"No matter how prosperous a civilization may be, it falls apart in an instant ... Talk about abrupt."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_203,I suppose that means the mistake they made was just that great.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_204,"A large theater, a market, and more ... The people who lived here must've been really well-off."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_205,"Yes, living in the capital would have required a lot of money."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_206,"Since this is the commercial district, a lot of merchants must've gathered here back in the day."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_207,"Now the buildings have been restored, but the streets are still lonely and empty ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_208,"The more you can tell that this place used to be lively, the sadder it feels that no one is around."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_209,Yeah. Especially since the buildings look completely new.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_210,I don't like thinking about how alchemy can be used like this ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_211,"It wasn't used in a good way, but ultimately, any power lies in the hands of the person wielding it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_212,"The truth of Aladiss ... The light of prosperity, and the darkness behind it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_213,"Alchemy is what developed the country to this point, and it's also what destroyed it. Ironic, isn't it?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_214,"It's not dark or full of monsters here, but it's still kind of a scary place ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_215,"Yeah, I'm not gettin' a great feelin' from here either. Let's just finish our business and get outta here quick."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_216,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_217,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_218,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_219,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_220,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_221,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_222,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_223,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_224,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_225,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_226,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_227,
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_228,"Okay, time to take a look around."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_229,"Phew ... All right, time to get going."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_230,Let's go take a look around!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_231,"C'mon, let's get a move on."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_232,"Now then, where shall we explore first?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_233,Let's head out!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_234,"Yikes, the mana here is really thick. We'd better watch our step."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_235,"There's an awful lot of mana around. Be careful, everyone."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_236,"Whoa, the mana's really thick here. I'd rather not stick around any longer than we have to."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_237,"Tch, I can't focus in here. Let's do what we're here for and then get out."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_238,I can't say that I've ever enjoyed going to manabound areas.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_239,O-ooooh boy ... There's a whole bunch of mana here. Make sure to keep an eye on how you're all feeling!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_240,Entry into manabound area confirmed. Please avoid wasteful energy consumption.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_241,We need to keep an eye on our remaining energy.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_242,"Yeah, if it runs out here, we probably won't be able to recover from it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_243,"We have energy, but this still feels suffocating. Isla, how are you holding up?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_244,"I'm feeling decent enough, but I'd rather hurry up and get out of here."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_245,"Yep, manabound areas are anything but fun."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_246,"You can say that again. I can't relax, even if we do have energy. Let's get out of here, and quick."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_247,"We still have energy left, but my head feels like it weighs a ton."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_248,It's easy to tell just how dangerous this area is. My head has been hurting since a little while ago as well ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_249,"Lenja, are you feeling okay? You look a little out of it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_250,"Ugh ... I might not be feeling the greatest ... B-but, we still have energy, so I can keep going!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_251,"Even though we've got energy to spare, this is kind of rough."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_252,"The Energy Core is operating without error. However, I would suggest that you leave this area as soon as possible."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_253,"My head's still buzzing, but I'm really glad that we made it out of there."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_254,"Thank goodness, we're out. Is everyone all right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_255,"Freeeeedooooom! Wow, do I love fresh air!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_256,"Great, looks like we made it. How're we doin' on energy?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_257,Phew ... That is not a place where you would want to overstay your welcome.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_258,"Whew, w-we made it ... I'd rather just go around the next one ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_259,Exit from manabound area confirmed. That took considerably longer than expected.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_266,Only half of your mana energy remains. Take care to efficiently manage your supply.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_273,Very little of your mana energy remains. Flammi will not be held responsible if you run out at a crucial moment.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_287,Your mana energy is fully depleted. Flammi's mood is also at zero. Please do something about this.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_288,"Eugh, I'm soaking wet ... I hate that damp, clingy feeling."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_289,Wet clothing really does suck the warmth right out of you. We'd better hurry and dry off.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_290,"Nooo, I'm all wet! And cold! This is the worst ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_291,"If I was gonna grumble about bein' a little wet, I wouldn't be an adventurer."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_292,It certainly gets chilly when you're soaked. I would appreciate a chance to change or dry off by a fire.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_293,"Oooh, I'm soaked right down to my tail ... If I don't dry off soon, I'll catch a-a-atchoo!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_294,Looks like a pain in the neck's loitering around here.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_295,"Watch out, there's a strong enemy nearby!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_296,"Is it just me, or are we in trouble?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_297,"There's ... definitely somethin' strong hangin' around here, yeah."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_298,"Be on your guard, there's trouble about."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_299,I'm sensing a really strong enemy ...!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_300,Flammi is detecting the presence of a formidable foe. Please select either fight or flight.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_301,"A monster swarm ...? Hm, that's a problem."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_302,"Shoot, they've banded up. What should we do?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_303,That's an awfully big group of monsters ... Should we really take them on?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_304,"So, you're aimin' to take on that swarm? Sure, I can get behind that."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_305,"They might be weak, but a crowd of them is concerning. We should avoid them if we are not prepared."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_306,I'm a little worried about going up against a whole group of enemies ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_307,"Flammi is detecting the presence of multiple enemies. If you choose to face them, take care."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_308,Maybe it's around here?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_309,"It should be around here, right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_310,Was this where we're supposed to go?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_311,Finally. It took forever to get here.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_312,"It was supposed to be around here, yes?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_313,I think this is about where we had that marker ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_314,You have arrived at your destination thanks to Flammi's excellent navigational skills.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_315,"*Sigh* We were up all night long ... I'd love to get some sleep, even if it's just a quick nap ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_316,"Yessir, breathing in the fresh morning air always wakes me up!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_317,*Yawn* ... I'm tired ... I just want to go home and sleep in a bed ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_318,"It's mornin', huh? Could we take a break somewhere?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_319,"Goodness, it's morning already. Is everyone feeling awake and alert?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_320,M-morning already ...? Don't worry! I'm still going strong!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_321,"It's almost noon, right? We should stop somewhere and take a lunch break."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_322,It's almost lunchtime. We'd better eat a good meal to keep our strength up.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_323,"Hey, shouldn't we have lunch soon?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_324,"If we're not gonna stop, we should at least have lunch on the go. Hunger's the enemy of exploration."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_325,Is anyone hungry? Perhaps we should stop somewhere for lunch.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_326,My stomach's empty ...<CR>Can we eat lunch soon?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_327,The sun's about to set. What should we do? Call it a day?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_328,... It's going to get dark soon. Are we going to keep exploring?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_329,It's already this late? It's going to get dark really soon.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_330,"It's just about night, huh? Explorin' gets a lot more dangerous in the dark."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_331,The day is about to end. Is everyone good to keep going?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_332,I-it's gotten awfully dark ... We'd better be more careful.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_333,"I don't like not being able to see as well, but some ingredients only show up at night, so there's no avoiding it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_334,The odds of sudden monster attacks get higher in the dark. Take good stock of your surroundings.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_335,"It's already pitch black ... Whether we keep moving on or head back, it'll be just as dangerous."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_336,"Keep your eyes open, folks. Monsters and relics are both a lot harder to spot in the dark."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_337,"While moving about carelessly in this darkness can be perilous, staying in one place is just as risky."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_338,"I-I can hear monsters growling. They're not c-coming for me, are they ...?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_375,I wouldn't mind sorting through my bags while we take a bit of a break.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_376,We might as well take a breather now. Wouldn't want anyone getting hurt because they're pushing too hard.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_377,"Phew, I'm exhausted. I could really use a nice, relaxing bath right about now."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_378,"Since there are other folks around here, we should try to gather some info."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_379,"Oh, we might have a chance to rest somewhere with a roof over our heads."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_380,"I'd really like to, um, wash my hair. Is there a bath around here?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_381,"You know, I'm really not a fan of stifling places like this."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_382,"Most caves house some decently strong monsters. Keep your guard up, everyone!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_383,"Another cave? That means more freaky bugs, right? Uuuugh, I'm seriously no good with those things!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_384,A cave without any treasure's just a useless tunnel. Which do you think this one'll be?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_385,I don't care much for that clammy scent that lingers in caves.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_386,I'm no good with damp places like these. It makes my hair go all frizzy ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_387,Should we take a break?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_388,"Why don't we have a little rest? Fatigue's the enemy of any good survey, after all."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_389,I'm staaaaarving. Can't we rest for a bit?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_390,"There's no tellin' what we'll be up against next, so it's good to rest whenever we get the chance."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_391,This looks like it would be a good spot to set up camp. Should we stop for a moment or two?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_392,"I think this'd be a nice place for a break, but what do you say? ... Oh! Um, me? I've still got plenty of energy!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_393,Who built this? And what was it for?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_394,It would be nice if there was still something useful here ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_395,"Since someone went through the trouble of sealing this up, there's got to be something good inside!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_396,Don't go gettin' your hopes up too high. What passed as treasure then might not be worth much now.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_397,I wonder what is stored here?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_398,This is so exciting! Wh-what do you think could be inside?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_399,"Absolutely any of this would be useful, so let's gather as much as we can!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_400,"Gathering a bunch of stuff doesn't bother me, but remember that we have to carry it back, okay?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_401,"Hm? You're looking to gather up everything here? Sure, I can help with that!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_402,"I don't really get all this, but ... this stuff's basically treasure for alchemists?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_403,"I'm all for gathering even more, provided that it will not spoil."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_404,You want me to gather up everything in sight? C-can do!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_405,"Is this a monster nest? Shoot, we might really be in trouble ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_406,"There are signs of monster activity all over ... Be sure to stick together, everyone."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_407,Pee-yew! This place reeks of monsters! That's really not a good sign ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_408,"If you startle 'em, they'll attack.<CR>... Okay, they'll basically attack no matter what, but still."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_409,"We may be attacked at any moment. Be on your guard, everyone."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_410,W-we should get out of here fast! This place is c-crawling with monsters ...!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_413,"Oh, just some small fry."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_420,This should give us a bit of an edge.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_427,Oh ... This one might be trouble.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_434,"Huh, so that's how it works."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_441,"Okay, what do we have here ...?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_448,"Really? Nothing? Huh, wasn't expecting that ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_449,"Scan complete. No readings detected. No, Flammi is not malfunctioning."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_450,I'm picking something up.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_451,That looks like ... an enemy?!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_452,This reading ... means there might be treasure here!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_453,Whoa! That's a whole bunch of readings!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_454,Wow! That's a lot of readings!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_455,"Yep, it's time to get a move on."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_456,"All right, let's get going."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_457,That's enough rest. Let's get back to exploring!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_458,"We all got plenty of rest, right? C'mon, let's go."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_459,Being well-rested means we have that much more energy to explore.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_460,That was a great rest! I'm back at full power!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_461,"Phew, I'm stuffed. Maybe we should go walk this off."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_462,"It's always good to exercise after a big meal. Come on, let's get going."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_463,"I'm so full, I might just doze off. Let's get back to exploring before I get too cozy."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_464,"Yep, that was enough to get me back up and runnin'."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_465,"Well, we'd better walk it off. ... The meal, I mean. For good health."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_466,"I ate a bunch, so now I'll move around a bunch!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_479,I think we could use this if I had the right sort of glove.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_480,"Whoops, did we forget to bring bait?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_483,We're too low on energy ... Is there anywhere nearby where we can replenish it?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_484,Found something!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_485,"Ooh, nice!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_486,Is this it?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_487,I'll grab some.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_488,Aha!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_489,I'll be taking this!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_490,Is this the stuff?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_491,This is pretty dull work.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_492,"This, yes?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_493,I've collected some.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_494,I found it!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_495,I got it!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_496,"Water is pretty heavy, so let me carry it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_497,You can leave the heavy stuff to me!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_498,It's important to leave the root so you can gather more later.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_499,It feels like I'm a kid again. I used to get stuck weedin' all the time ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_500,Ow! Aaaargh! I hate all these stupid spikes!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_501,"If you pinch the spines, you can pick them up safely."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_502,"Flower picking, huh? I used to do this all the time as a kid ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_503,We should decorate the atelier with any extras we find!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_504,Turning this into something palatable is the hardest part of the whole process ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_505,Raw medicinal ingredients won't really make ya much money.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_506,"Shoot, I touched it with my bare hands. Hope I don't get a rash ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_507,Eugh! Wh-what's that smell ...?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_508,That's an elixir for you. It's incredibly powerful as an ingredient.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_509,An elixir ... I guess this might turn a profit.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_510,"Please tell me you only need a small bag of this. Sand gets very heavy, you know."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_511,"Now that I'm getting a closer look at the sand, I enjoy how the little grains shimmer and shine."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_512,"Oof, that's heavy ...! Viktor, swap with me!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_513,"Okay, got it! Um, do we need any more of this?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_514,"I've seen this ore in books before. I don't remember what it's called, though."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_515,"Ore's low effort, high value. So, I made a point of learnin' which is which."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_516,"It's not surprising that gemstones are so valuable, given how hard they are to find."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_517,"I recognize most raw gemstones. After all, they are the source of jewels."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_518,U-um! Is it really okay for a total beginner like me to be handling this?!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_519,Would it be all right if I took a little of this gunpowder? I'd like to use some of it for my gun.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_520,I feel like firing a gun while I'm carrying this would be a bad idea ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_521,It smells like fuel ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_522,"It's edible, but you can do more than just cook with it. What should we use it in?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_523,Spendin' Cole on this stuff seems foolish if it's this easy to gather.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_524,"Don't worry, I'll make sure to grab the ones the bugs haven't gotten to already."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_525,"Um, these smell really good when they're roasted. Definitely try that if you're going to eat them!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_526,Whoa! There was still a bee in here! Watch that you don't get stung!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_527,"It's brimming with natural honey, which is good for the body."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_528,"There are mushrooms you shouldn't eat mixed in here, so make sure to triple-check them before taking a bite!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_529,"Remember, there's no easy way to tell if a mushroom's poisonous or not."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_530,Now that's a fresh fish! I'm sure it would be delicious no matter how you prepare it.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_531,"I'm pretty good at catching fish, too! I just take aim and grab them!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_532,"Eeeew, I hate bugs!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_533,"You only need your hands to catch bugs. Once you're used to it, they beat any net."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_534,"Shoot, I can't get this untangled.<CR>... Hm? It's fine as-is?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_535,"If you wind it around your fingertips like so ...<CR>There, a perfect bundle."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_536,"Lumber might be bulky, but it's useful to have. I'd be happy to carry it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_537,"If you chop it, you're carryin' it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_538,"... Is this gathering it? I can't see it, so I can't tell."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_539,"Um, gathering gases is really tricky ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_540,This stuff is cool and springy. Squeezing it is so soothing!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_541,I would love to try making a bed out of this to see what sleeping on it would feel like ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_542,"Eugh, it still smells like beast! I don't think I'm a fan of this stuff ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_543,"""Freshly gathered"" equates to ""uncooked,"" doesn't it?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_544,Equipment made from dragon materials is of the highest quality. It's the kind of thing explorers dream of owning.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_545,Dragon materials are very rare. We can't waste these!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_546,"It feels a lot like mana, but it's got a different kind of power ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_547,"... Well, I can't deny that it's magical. Not that I know anythin' about this kind of thing, though."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_548,Hmm ... This looks really old.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_549,"Wow, this is in such good condition."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_560,"This makes getting around quicker and easier, but it sure burns up energy ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_561,"Even so, it does make things much easier. Let's be grateful for it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_564,"While this makes getting around a breeze, it takes a certain skill. It feels like it'll fall over if I'm not paying attention."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_565,"Aw, Viktor! You've always been clumsy like that, huh? But, seriously—make sure it doesn't fall over, okay?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_568,"I was a bit scared the first time I rode this, but now that I'm used to it, it's great!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_569,"You haven't forgotten that it burns through energy, right? Everythin' gets ten times harder if we run out."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_572,"Look, I get that this is faster and less work, but honestly, I get a bit nervous if my feet aren't touchin' the ground."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_573,"Oh, that's unexpected. Here I thought you would like this kind of vehicle the most out of all of us."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_576,"While I appreciate the speed and overall usefulness of this, it's a shame that it isn't good with sharp turns."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_577,"Y-yeah. It's useful when we're in a hurry, but it might be better to walk when we're looking for something."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_580,Did everyone in Aladiss ride these to get around?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_581,"Probably not all the time, but I think it's safe to say that everyone owned one."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_584,"There, that should be much safer."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_585,"Good, now everyone can breathe a bit easier."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_586,There's nothing to worry about now ... right?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_587,"Great, now we can take a leisurely look around."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_588,"Phew, things have finally settled down."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_589,My hair's not standing on end anymore! That means it's all clear!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_590,Yay! Got one!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_591,All right! Caught one!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_592,"Hey, look! I got one!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_593,Ha! Fishin' is child's play!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_594,*Chuckle* I think I see the appeal of fishing now.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_595,Fishing's pretty fun!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_596,That wasn't any trouble at all!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_597,That takes care of that.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_598,Okay! That was nothing!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_599,That one didn't even count.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_600,... Could that have been considered bullying?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_601,I can still keep going!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_602,"Oof, that was a bit of a tough one ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_603,"We won, but that was a close one. Is everyone all right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_604,"Oof, that was a bit of a tough one ... Could we maybe sit down for a second?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_605,"Tch, I'm achin' all over ... Are we seriously gonna keep goin' like this?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_606,That was a close one ... I would like to stop somewhere to recover.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_607,"I'm really sorry, but ...<CR>Oooh, I'm a little beat up ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_608,"That was a strong one, but we made it through ... How are you all holding up?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_609,"That sure was a formidable opponent, but what matters is that we took it down safely."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_610,"I can't believe we beat something that strong ... Seriously, somebody pinch me!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_611,"Heh, I'll bet they regret picking a fight with ME."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_612,Phew ... I only hope there isn't more where that came from.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_613,W-we actually won! My heart's still pounding ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_614,Now this is even easier to wield. Changing the center of gravity was the right way to go.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_615,It can shoot. It can whack. This is just the gun I wanted.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_616,I might be the only one in the whole world who has a gun this strong ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_617,"You know, I never would've believed I'd end up making a gun this powerful."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_618,Is that my new weapon? I can't wait to get out and see how it works.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_619,"Hm? It's actually got quite a bit of heft to it. No, I like it. It makes it easier to wield."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_620,"The size hasn't changed, but it's a lot sturdier. This is going to make for a great shield."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_621,"I've never seen a weapon quite like this. If anything, the thought of wielding it is making me nervous."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_622,Woo! New spear time! I'll use it a lot!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_623,"Oh, wow! This is super easy to use! I love it!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_624,"Oooh, this sure is flexible. I could probably stab anything and it wouldn't snap!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_625,"Whoa, this sure is heavy ... But, I can handle it!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_626,"Huh, a new scythe? Thanks, I could use that."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_627,"Huh, you really worked on makin' it easy to swing. Yeah, it's pretty decent."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_628,Now that's a sharp edge. It's even making ME nervous.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_629,Have you ever thought about taking up weaponsmithin' instead?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_630,"Hm, the handle on this is quite good. Thank you very much."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_631,"It's lightweight and has less recoil, which does assist with accuracy. Thank you."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_632,"The caliber is larger than before ...?<CR>Yes, this will be very powerful indeed."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_633,What a rambunctious-looking weapon. *Chuckle* I cannot wait to use it.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_634,Th-thank you very much. I promise I'll take really good care of it!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_635,"So, this is my new sword? It fits my hands perfectly ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_636,I can already tell ... This is definitely going to be a legendary sword!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_637,"I can slice anything with this! Seriously, that's how amazing it is ...!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_638,"Well, I can synthesize stuff anywhere as long as it's nothing too complicated."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_639,Alchemists sure are something. Being able to make simple things in a flash really is impressive.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_640,It's so cool that you can just make things whenever and wherever you want!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_641,"That's an alchemist for you. Just makin' stuff left and right, without even blinkin'."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_642,You synthesize with such ease that I'm finding it hard to believe that it isn't a form of magic.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_643,Synthesizing all kinds of things while you're on the go looks like a lot of fun.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_644,"Wait, do I have too much stuff? My bag looks pretty bulky ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_645,We won't be cramming anything else into these bags. They're completely stuffed.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_646,Maybe I'll take a picture to remember this by.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_647,Whoops ... Looks like we can't go any further.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_648,Hmm ... Seems like this is as far as we can go.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_649,"Okay, I think this should last a while."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_650,Let's try not to use this all up at once.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_651,"Even if there is treasure left, wouldn't it be degraded?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_652,Hopefully something in here helps with our investigation.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_653,I'd love to find some ancient clothes still in good condition in here.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_654,"There's no way there'll be nothin' left, right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_655,"There's no guarantee treasure from the past will still have value, but hopefully we find something nice."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_656,The air feels so strange ... Has it really been trapped inside this treasure trove since way back then?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_657,It's pointing at something ... Maybe we can find a clue about how to activate the shrine.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_658,Looks like it's pointing us somewhere. Maybe it's got something to do with this shrine.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_659,"So we just have to go where the shrine points, right? Let's check them out one at a time!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_660,"No idea where this'll lead us, but it can't hurt to be on guard."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_661,Perhaps visiting all the places the shrine shows us will make something happen?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_662,So ... it's saying to go here? I-I wonder what'll happen ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_663,"Wow, it's an Energy Prism! It was tough, but I'm glad we managed to activate this shrine!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_664,Is this an Energy Prism? Now I get why this thing was so well-protected.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_665,"This is an Energy Prism, right? Looks like all that work getting it activated paid off!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_666,"Oh, this is an Energy Prism, right? Don't mind if I do!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_667,"An Energy Prism? I see, that explains why it was so difficult to activate."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_668,"Oh, this is an Energy Prism ... Right? It was stored away in a place like this ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_669,We're almost at the spot marked by the shrine. Let's check it out.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_670,I think the spot marked by the shrine is around here. I wonder what we'll find.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_671,Is that the spot marked by the shrine over there? Let's go check it out!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_672,"Huh, so that's where we're goin'? Looks safe enough to take a closer look."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_673,"So, that's where it was pointing. Let's inspect it closely and think about our next move."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_674,"O-oh, look! There it is! That's the place!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_675,Looks like we're all done here. Let's head to the next spot.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_676,"All right, that's it for this place. Let's go check the next spot that the shrine marked on the map."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_677,That takes care of this spot! Let's go check out the next one.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_678,"All right, let's hurry to the next one."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_679,"We're one step closer to activating the shrine. Now, on to the next one."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_680,I think we've settled everything here. L-let's go check out the next area!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_681,That was easy. Talk about good luck.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_682,"This is an Energy Shard, correct? Even just a fragment is a big help."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_683,"Hey, this is an Energy Shard, right? Finders keepers!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_684,"This thing's an Energy Shard, ain't it? Hold on here, shouldn't they at least try to make it hard to get?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_685,An Energy Prism ... shard? This may come in handy if we collect a few more.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_686,"I-it's just a shard, but I bet we can use them if we collect a bunch ... Right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_687,I hope we find something interesting in here.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_688,"More importantly, let's keep our guard up. Some monsters make their nest inside ruins."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_689,Viktooor! Don't say scary stuff!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_690,"If Eustella was destroyed today, I doubt its ruins would be this intact hundreds of years later."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_691,Eustella isn't as advanced as Aladiss. Everything would likely fall apart within a hundred years.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_692,"That might be true, but can we please talk about something less depressing?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_693,Hey! I've never seen this kind of bug before.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_694,"I'm sure there're all sorts of bugs in here you can't find in Eustella ... Huh? You okay, Lenja?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_695,I-I can't stand bugs with creepy-crawly legs!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_696,Ruins are always so dusty.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_697,That's proof that no one has been taking care of them for a long time.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_698,But the dust doesn't really pile up. Is that because monsters are always coming and going?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_699,Hellooo? Is anybody home?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_700,What're you gonna do if someone actually answers when you do that?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_701,"Run, obviously! That would be way too scary!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_702,It would be nice to find some ingredients for the settlement in here.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_703,That sounds super heavy. How would we even carry something like that back?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_704,Hahaha. Want to take a look inside my bag and see?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_705,Ngh ... Doesn't being in ruins make your hair stand on end?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_706,I can't say it does. You've got pretty finely-tuned senses though. Maybe you're sensing something?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_707,"Y-yeah, but ... not knowing what that ""something"" is ... that's the really scary part."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_708,"Hey, let me know if you spot anythin' that looks valuable."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_709,Anything valuable ... Hm? Is this pretty rock ... a jewel?!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_710,"... You just sit this one out, Viktor. Work on your sense of beauty first."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_711,I wonder if the people of this age will eventually try to fix or destroy these ancient ruins.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_712,"I'm sure it'll happen. Our world might feel vast, but we'll run out of room eventually."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_713,Dead flowers get plucked to make room to plant new seeds. That's all there is to it.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_714,"If you feel your heart poundin' with anticipation when you enter ruins, it's important to take a deep breath and calm yourself."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_715,You mean because I might get too excited and not notice the monsters?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_716,Because it's more likely there's nothing in here. We should count ourselves lucky if there is.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_717,My clothes always get so dirty while investigating ruins. It makes it hard to keep my spirits up.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_718,Just leave all that to me! I can solve any and all of your clothing concerns!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_719,"Wow! I-I'll make sure to ask you next time, too!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_720,I wonder if this also used to be a peaceful place protected by knights.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_721,Hmm ... Thinking about it that way makes me feel a bit sad ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_722,Sorry. I didn't mean to get overly sentimental. Let's try to focus on the investigation.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_723,"These ruins have been here for hundreds of years, right? No one has come in here for ages ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_724,We should be grateful. That's why there's so much left for us to bring back from our investigation.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_725,But it's also why there are so many monsters wandering around and making our work that much harder.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_726,We should prepare all the tools we'll need before we start investigating the ruins.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_727,"Whoa! A bit late for that, isn't it? We're already in here!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_728,Bein' unprepared can be a good reminder to be careful. Better than thinkin' you're ready for anythin'.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_729,H-huh? Doesn't this scrap of cloth look brand new?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_730,Could belong to relic hunters who snuck in here. Plenty of 'em went to Aladiss and never came back.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_731,"They may have come in without permission, but their lives were valuable. I hope they made it home safely."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_732,Do ruins ever have traps that make it so you can never leave?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_733,They do. I've been caught in traps like that exactly three times. Almost didn't make it out alive.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_734,"Three times? And you're not scared of it happening again? I'll admit, I'm impressed."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_735,Aren't you worried about firing your gun inside these confined ruins?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_736,Are you worried it might cause a cave-in? These ruins have held together for centuries. They'll be fine.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_737,"H-hey, now you've gone and made me imagine getting caught in a cave-in ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_738,"Have you ever had to go into ruins for your work as a, um, mercenary, Miss Nina?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_739,Of course. Though I always refused requests to fetch treasures from ruins. I'm no lowly relic hunter.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_740,Are there a lot of people who request stuff like that?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_741,Can any of the materials from the fixtures in these ruins be used as alchemy ingredients?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_742,"I'm sure they could, but I don't think it's worth damaging the ruins. I'd much rather they stay intact."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_743,Makes sense. These ruins have been untouched for centuries. It would feel wrong to damage them now.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_744,You'd better watch your step. I've heard reports of people getting hurt falling through the floor.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_745,"You've got a large frame, Viktor, so you should be particularly careful."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_746,"M-my sword is really heavy too ... Aah, I don't want to fall through the floor ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_747,Huh? I thought I had Burst Ammo on me ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_748,"Oh no, I forgot to bring Slicing Ammo ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_749,We have no Regular Ammo?! I should synthesize a bunch later.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_750,Looks like I don't have a key to open this.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_751,Huh? We don't have enough energy ... We'll need to go and replenish it.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_752,Let's find a safer place to drop down from.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_753,"Okay, that should do it!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_754,Seems like it moved.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_755,"Yay, it moved!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_756,"Oh, I think it moved."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_757,I think that did it.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_758,"That should do it, right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_759,Oof. That was a big drop. Thank goodness we had enough energy.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_760,"Even if we have energy, it doesn't make it any less scary ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_761,Nailed it!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_762,I won't let you get away!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_767,There!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_768,Hit it!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_773,We're not in a hurry. I can do this later.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_776,That's it? Easy-peasy!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_777,"Well, that should do it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_778,"Oh, we've been spotted."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_779,"Oh no, we've been discovered!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_780,Wh-wha—?! They spotted us!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_781,Tch. Damn perceptive monsters.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_782,"Oh dear, we've been found out."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_783,O-oh no! They saw us!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_784,The monsters are scared of us? Not sure how to feel about that ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_785,"Aw, dang. I wanted their materials ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_786,Come back! We weren't going to hurt you ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_787,"Hmm ... Maybe if we crouched low to the ground, they wouldn't run away from us."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_788,Shouldn't we be able to harvest the stuff in the greenhouse soon?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_789,Shouldn't the crops in the greenhouse be grown by now?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_790,Shouldn't we go check on the duplication machine soon?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_791,Shouldn't the duplication machine be done by now?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_792,I bet the mana converter's filled up. Let's check it out.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_793,Umm ... I think the mana converter might be full soon ... We should go look.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_794,I'm really worried about the base ... We should head back and check it out.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_795,"Hey, I think we should go check on the base. Feels like the monsters are acting up today."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_796,Can we go check up on the base? Something doesn't feel right ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_797,"*Sigh* ... Hey, we need to get back to base. Not sure why, but I've got a bad feelin'."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_798,It may be a good idea to return to base. We've been away for a while and I'm a little worried.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_799,U-umm! Can we go back to the base? I have this really bad feeling about it all of a sudden.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_800,Something tells me someone wants to talk to me. I'll ask about it once we're back at the base.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_801,"Hey, Yumia. Can you make some time for a chat with me when we're back at base?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_802,"Hey, Yumia. Do you have a minute to talk when we get back to the base?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_803,"Hey, make some time when we're back at base. I wanna chat with you about somethin'."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_804,"There's something I'd like to talk to you about, Yumia. Can you come see me back at the base?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_805,"U-um, if it's not too much trouble ... I'd like to talk about something back at the base. Please!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_806,What?! The container's full? I should've taken the time to organize it ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_807,The container looks like it's almost out of room. I should really clean it up a bit.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_808,Ugh ... S-staying here without energy is really overwhelming ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_809,You said it ... Feels like my mind's being ripped apart ... We need to get out of here!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_810,Th-this is intense ... I don't think I can stay here for much longer ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_811,Me neither ... I really don't like it here. I want to leave ... I want to go home.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_812,I c-can't focus ... Feels like my mind keeps wandering ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_813,"Tch, damned place. Tryin' to mess with our minds! Let's get out of here!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_814,What if ... What if we can never leave this place ...?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_815,Listen to me! This place is just confusing you. You're okay. Keep moving and we'll make it out.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_816,"I didn't expect this to be so mentally exhausting ... How are you feeling, Lenja?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_817,I-I don't know ... It feels like I'm being overwhelmed with anxiety ... I-I'm really scared ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_818,U-ugh ... My chest hurts ... And I'm having trouble breathing ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_819,Symptoms caused by harmful effects of manabound area. Please remain calm and quickly exit the area.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_820,"All right, that should get it moving."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_821,I wonder if that thing'll move now.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_822,Okaaay! Let's go check if it'll move now!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_823,That should do it. Let's go see if we can move it.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_824,"Hmm, so this mechanism allows it to move. Let's go take a look and see if it worked."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_825,Will it be able to move now?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_826,"Ugh, ouch. That was definitely way too high up ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_827,Ack! Ngh ... W-we didn't have enough energy for that one ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_828,I hope this thing's safe.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_829,This should help.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_830,Phew. That felt good.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_831,Sometimes you just need to smash your way through.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_832,"Oh no, I missed!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_833,"No way, I missed?!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_834,"Okay! Scanning complete. I don't know if it'll be enough to turn the tables, though ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_835,Hmm. I think what we're looking for should be around here somewhere.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_836,Isn't that thing we're looking for somewhere nearby?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_837,I bet what we're looking for is nearby. Let's look around and see if we can find it.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_838,"The thing we were lookin' for is nearby. Trust me, my intuition's always right."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_839,What we're searching for is likely around here. Let's look for it as we walk around the area.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_840,U-um! I-I feel like the thing we were looking for is around here. Should we look for it?!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_841,Weak signal from current search target detected. Careful investigation of the area is advised.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_842,Just looking at this stone is really soothing. I wonder why?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_843,"Ow! Ugh, seriously?! This fish is rock-solid!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_844,A bug with jewels on its back? I'm a little worried about people gathering way more of these than they should.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_845,"There's a serious amount of power packed into this plant, but most people wouldn't believe me if I told them that."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_846,So that was the last of the ammo. We sure used a bunch.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_847,"That was the last one ... We're going to need more, so we should stock up soon."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_848,So this glove's the last one? Better make some more before I forget.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_849,Huh? We're out of bait. I should make some more. We'll definitely need it.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_850,We've used up the last of the camping tools. Better make more soon.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_851,"Running out of bandages is a bit scary. There's no telling when we'll need them, so I should make a bunch."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_852,"When this is all over, I'd love to have a nice, relaxing time camping. Somewhere quiet with no monsters ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_853,"Camping sure is fun. I feel totally rejuvenated. C'mon, let's head out!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_854,"Ugh, my back is killing me ... I think I like sleeping in beds a lot better."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_855,Gettin' to leave right after wakin' up's the best part of campin'. So quit slackin' and let's go.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_856,"Ah, I feel so well-rested. Now let's get back to our investigation, shall we?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_857,I-I kept hearing animals and monsters all night. Sleeping outside is s-scary ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_858,That should do it. Having bandages on hand sure gives me peace of mind.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_859,Using clean bandages gives me a real sense of security.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_860,Phew! I just hope this doesn't leave a scar.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_861,"When you're injured, just wrap it in some bandages. It'll heal eventually."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_862,"Tie it tightly, and ... there. This injury won't be a bother anymore."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_863,"I'm good at tying bandages, y'know! I've always been prone to injuries and I always treat them myself!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_864,"Is this a thanks for the snack? Well, thank you, too!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_865,Are they saying thank you? These animals sure are clever.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_866,"Oh, it's left something for us ... Is this a thank you for the food?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_867,"Whoa, now. That animal was carrying some good stuff."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_868,*Chuckle* Looks like we got something as well. Thank you for the cute gift.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_869,Huh? What? Th-the animal left us something. Is it really okay to take this?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_870,This should last us for now.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_871,This should be enough for the time being.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_872,This looks like it turned out pretty well. Maybe I should go try it on.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_873,"Well, we went to the trouble of making it. Better try it on and make sure it's ready to go."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_874,We should bring this with us. Gotta make sure it's ready to use whenever we need it!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_875,Better carry this with us. Not much point makin' it if it's not good to go when we need it most.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_876,It's good to equip weapons as soon as you've made them. Forgetting to do so could be dangerous.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_877,We should equip things right away! People used to get mad at me for forgetting to when I was a kid.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_878,I feel a bit better now. My body even seems lighter.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_879,Hm. I'm feeling somewhat off. I need to take care not to bump into things ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_880,*Sigh* That was tough. Thank goodness our Energy Core was full.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_881,"Oh no, the Energy Core's not looking great. We'll need to rest for a bit before we can use it again."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_882,"Oof, that was painful ... That might've been a bit too tough for us."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_883,There might be something around here. We should take a closer look.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_884,There's just something about this place ... I think we should take a look around.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_885,This feels like the kind of spot where you'd find something. Let's give it a look!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_886,"My intuition's tellin' me that there's somethin' not too far away. C'mon, let's go see what we stumble on."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_887,"... I see, there appears to be something nearby. I suppose it wouldn't hurt to check."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_888,"Hmm ...? I'm sensing ... something. And it's not too far away, either. ... I think? Maybe?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_889,"Someone's definitely watching us ... I don't think they're looking for a fight, though."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_890,Hm ... It seems that there's someone in need of help.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_891,Is anyone else getting the feeling that they're being stared at?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_892,"Ugh, that look just screams, ""More trouble than it's worth."""
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_893,"Oh, that person appears to be in need of assistance."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_894,U-um! I think that person could use a hand ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_895,"Yumia, do you have a minute?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_896,"Yumia, you've gotta hear me out!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_897,"Hey, come over here, would ya? I've got somethin' I need to ask."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_898,"Yumia, there was something I was hoping to get your opinion on."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_899,"U-um, Miss Yumia? Could I maybe bother you for a second or two?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_900,Let's look into this.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_901,Let's look into it during our investigation.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_902,It'd be nice if we can find it.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_903,This sort of thing's right in my area of expertise.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_904,I rather enjoy investigative work.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_905,L-let's do our best to get to the bottom of this!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_906,"This looks like trouble, but we can't just let them roam free."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_907,Oh? This looks like it will be a good test of strength.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_908,"With everyone working together, I'm sure this'll work out!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_909,"The sooner we start, the sooner we can get this over with."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_910,They certainly seem to be strong ... Is everyone adequately prepared?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_911,W-we're going up against that ...? Okay ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_912,We'd better help them.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_913,We can't ignore someone in need!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_914,I can't just ignore them when they're in that much trouble.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_915,"I'll help out as much as needed, so long as it's for a request."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_916,Let's give them our help.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_917,"I want to help people in need! So, I-I'll ... do my best!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_918,"Usually, Viktor's the one doing me favors, so I definitely can't ignore a request from him."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_919,There's no way I could turn down a request from Isla.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_920,"A request from Rutger? ... Odds are, I'll be rewarded for it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_921,"I owe Nina a lot, so the least I can do is lend her a hand when she needs it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_922,"I'd hate to see Lenja looking down, so I'll do what I can."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_923,"Okay, let's go report back."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_924,"There, now we just have to report it and we'll be done."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_925,"Phew! Finally done! ... Well, aside from turning it in, I guess."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_926,"Great, time to give 'em the good news."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_927,"That should be the last of it, yes? Then, we simply have to report it and receive the reward."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_928,"W-we're all done, right? Okay, let's go turn it in!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_929,Huh? We've actually got everything we need for that.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_930,"We have everything on hand, so let's hand it in right away."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_931,"Huh? Don't we have this? Great, then we can just pass it along!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_932,"Would ya look at that, we've already got the set. C'mon, let's hurry up and cross this off the list."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_933,"Oh, don't we have all that? Well then, we should turn it in quickly."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_934,"Hm? We've actually got everything they asked for. So, we can just ... hand it over, right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_935,"Well, that's that."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_936,Phew ... Seems we managed to pull that off safely.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_937,Dooone! I'm treating myself to some sweets after that one!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_938,That was no big deal.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_939,"It looks like we did it, thank goodness."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_940,"I-I did a good job, right ...?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_941,"Great, that's over and done with. I'm not going to lie, that was pretty tough ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_942,"I'm just glad that we took it down. Be sure to treat your injuries, everyone."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_943,"D-did we do it? They're down and out? Phew, thank goodness!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_944,"That was a pain, but it's not like they were any match for me to start with."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_945,"It seems we managed to succeed. Though, I hope we don't have to face off against any other strong foes for a while."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_946,"W-we did it! We took them out! That's it, right? We're all done?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_947,I'm glad we got to do something nice for them.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_948,We were able to lend someone our strength ... I'm glad.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_949,"Wow, they were super happy! Yep, it always feels nice to do good things."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_950,"I mean, it's not like gettin' these sorts of favors done for folks is hard or anything."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_951,"Wonderfully done. Should we find someone else in need of assistance, I hope that we'll take the time for them."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_952,"I'm happy, but more than that, I'm glad that we were able to do it ... The relief might outweigh everything else."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_953,"Thank you, Yumia. That helps a lot."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_954,"Thanks a bunch, Yumia! I knew you were the right person to ask!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_955,"Not bad, Yumia. Thanks."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_956,"I'm sorry for tasking you with something so tedious, but I do appreciate the help."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_957,"Th-thank you very much, Miss Yumia! That really helps!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_958,"I feel bad, but I think we should drop this request. I really should stop saying yes to everything ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_959,"As much as I hate to say it, I don't think we have any choice but to give up on this one."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_960,"Urrrgh, that's the worst feeling ever. We should be more careful from now on."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_961,"Look, there's no point to overextendin' and collapsin'. Sometimes you gotta have the courage to give up."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_962,I'll have to make sure that giving up doesn't become second nature to me.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_963,"We don't have any other choice, right? I'm really sorry ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_964,Let's quit while we're still ahead.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_965,"In the end, we bit off more than we could chew."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_966,We're too busy for that right now.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_967,It's not like we've got all the time in the world for this stuff.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_968,We can try this again some other time.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_969,As much as this bothers me ... we're really not in a great spot for that right now.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_970,"There, that should be all of them. Let's head back to the shrine."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_971,It would be nice if that changed something ... I suppose we'll have to check the shrine and see.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_972,We finally found all of them! I really hope that did something to the shrine ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_973,"Yep, that's the lot of 'em. Time to head back to the shrine."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_974,I believe that was the last one. Hopefully something at the shrine has changed as a result ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_975,"Th-that was all of them, right? Okay! Let's go back to the shrine!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_976,Huh? Any idea where that fruit I was saving is?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_977,The red one? It's happily sittin' in my belly.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_978,Hey! Spit it out right this instant!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_979,"Everything around here is so new to me, it's tempting to just go wandering off."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_980,I know how you feel! Everywhere I look seems like another interesting place to visit.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_981,"I know it's exciting, but please don't run off on your own."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_982,Lenja's so expressive and adorable!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_983,She's cryin' half the time though.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_984,Th-that ... might actually be true ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_985,"Let's see. Ingredients, ingredients ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_986,Don't get too caught up with your ingredients. You'll end up as monster food.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_987,Right back at you! Don't let the monsters catch you off guard while you're looking for your precious loot.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_988,*Yawn* I'm starting to get a bit sleepy.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_989,*Yawn* Me too ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_990,Yawns are ... *Yawn* contagious ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_991,I wonder what kind of fish can be caught around here.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_992,We're having fish for dinner today?!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_993,Nobody said anythin' about dinner.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_994,"Man, my shoulders are killin' me. Workin' in a group really ain't my thing."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_995,"Yeah, you aren't one to cooperate."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_996,It feels different hearin' it from someone else ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_997,"Whoa, did you see something move over there just now?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_998,"Could be a monster. That, or maybe a ghost ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_999,"What kinda nonsense are you spoutin'? C'mon, let's get goin' already. Hey, quit gawkin' and get movin'! Go, go!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1000,"Hmm, I should clean my gun soon."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1001,"Hm, speaking of gun maintenance ... It's about time I take care of mine too."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1002,*Chuckle* Let's take care of them together then.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1003,"Yumia, we've walked pretty far, are your legs holding up?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1004,I'm fine. I go for walks all the time.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1005,"Oh, you do? You should show me your route next time."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1006,"If you see anything edible, be sure to gather some."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1007,"Viktor, make sure to gather vegetables and not just fruits."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1008,"We can't be fussy with our choices. As long as we can eat it, it's good enough."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1009,"Tch, ripped my clothes again. Probably snagged 'em on somethin'."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1010,Again? I just fixed them for you.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1011,It's because you move around so much.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1012,"Hmm, I should get some training in once we get back to base."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1013,"Viktor, haven't you trained enough?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1014,Never. I need every second I can get in order to get stronger.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1015,"Right, now where's the loot at?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1016,Stop wandering off like that!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1017,Hah! As if you aren't always dartin' around lookin' for ingredients.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1018,Honing our skills through combat is important.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1019,But resting up is just as important! How about we all have some fruit sandwiches?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1020,Hahaha! That sounds great. Your fruit sandwiches are the best.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1021,"Everyone, be quiet ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1022,"Oh, what's the matter? Enemies?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1023,"No, I just heard the call of a rare bird."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1024,Ah! I got my clothes all dirty!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1025,"All dirty? It's just a little mud, for cryin' out loud."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1026,A little mud is a big deal to me!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1027,"Uh oh, I think we might be lost."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1028,"No, it's okay. I remember the landmarks."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1029,"Perfect! What would we do without you, Isla?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1030,"I love gathering ingredients, but my bags sure get heavy ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1031,Should I carry them for you? I'm quite confident in my strength.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1032,"Oh, would you? That's really kind of you, Viktor."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1033,There might be somethin' interestin' around here. I'll go look around.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1034,"Rutger, refrain from any actions that may disturb the peace."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1035,"Yikes, talk about intense ... I got it, I got it ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1036,The plants in the Sivash region are so unique.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1037,Yeah. Synthesizing with them might produce some interesting results.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1038,"That's Yumia for you! Always thinking about alchemy, no matter what she sees."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1039,There are so many cutely colored plants around here.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1040,Some look a bit poisonous ... But I guess that's what makes them interesting!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1041,It does?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1042,"It's not quite Ligneus, but there's still a lot of nature around here."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1043,Except there's actual roads. Much easier to get around.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1044,True. Although it does seem like some parts are quite old ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1045,I couldn't fix my bed head at all today! Ugh.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1046,That little bit sticking out is actually really cute.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1047,You're just trying to make me feel better.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1048,*Sniff* *Sniff* Ehehe ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1049,"Lenja, you're looking rather cheerful."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1050,This scent around here reminds me of home. Probably because there's a Welleks settlement nearby.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1051,There's even some canals here. Might be nice for livin' quietly.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1052,"True ... Oh, but the lack of any shops would make it tough ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1053,"Yeah, didn't think it'd be up your alley."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1054,"Lenja, are you tired? You can ride on my back if you'd like."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1055,"Oh, um ... That's all right, I'm fine ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1056,No need to hold back! Just let me feel that fluff a little bit in return.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1057,Scaling the cliffs around the Sivash region would be excellent training.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1058,"That would be quite the challenge, even for you, Viktor. The terrain is incredibly steep."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1059,Hmm ... You think so? It might be more doable than you think.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1060,This area has some monsters that aren't found anywhere else.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1061,Indeed. This will be a chance to really show what I've got.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1062,I'll make sure that my guns are ready for battle then.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1063,I wonder if there are any ruins nearby.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1064,Finding ruins really makes it feel like an adventure! It's so exciting!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1065,Let me know if you spot anythin' valuable worth sellin'.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1066,I never knew Welleks lived in places like this.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1067,They could even be distant relatives of mine ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1068,"Oh, that's right! That would make for quite a touching story."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1069,Rutger! I almost bumped into your weapon again! It keeps getting in the way because it's too big!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1070,"Oh, shut it! If you can't see just how good a weapon it is, you've got some growin' up to do!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1071,"Come now, no fighting. Personally, I quite like Rutger's choice of weapon."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1072,I really didn't think we'd find a settlement all the way out here.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1073,"Where there's people, there's profit to be made. We should be able to find some good work here."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1074,Just make sure that doesn't distract you from the investigation.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1075,Investigating with everyone is wonderful. *Chuckle* It feels like the world is our oyster!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1076,"You're a lot more cheerful than I thought you would be, Nina."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1077,"Yeah. I didn't expect you to be so easy to talk to at first, but I'm glad you are!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1078,I'm barely keeping up with everyone ... I need to try harder ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1079,"There's no need to rush, Lenja. We should all move at our own pace."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1080,That's right! You're fine just the way you are!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1081,Phew. Time for a little rest.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1082,Me too. My legs are killing me from all this walking.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1083,Very well. Then I'll stand watch.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1084,"It's so humid around here, it's ruinin' my mood."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1085,"For once, I actually agree with you."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1086,"Just say, ""I know how you feel!"" then."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1087,Gazing at all these unfamiliar landscapes really makes you think.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1088,Yeah. It's nothing like back in Eustella.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1089,Indeed. It really puts into perspective how little I know about the world.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1090,"Hmm. The place we're going is this way, right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1091,"No! It's this way, silly! You really do get your head in the clouds sometimes, Yumia."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1092,"*Chuckle* That might be what makes her so endearing, though."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1093,You never know where monsters might be lurking. Let's proceed with caution.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1094,"I-if I notice any signs of monsters, I'll let you know right away!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1095,"Teamwork, huh? Ugh."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1096,"Pergrica Turm, the metal tree ... It has a nice ring to it. Good one, Chief."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1097,"Yes, it's quite nice. Pergrica Turm."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1098,You just like sayin' it ... It does have a nice sound though.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1099,"Some are hard, and some are sparkly ... The plants in the Auruma region sure are strange."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1100,"Yeah, they should make for some good ingredients. Let's collect what we can."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1101,"Hehe, your eyes are sparkling as well."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1102,"Yumia, are you feeling tired? We should take a break!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1103,"Now Isla, let her decide when she wants to stop. That only makes things hard on her."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1104,"I'm in tip-top shape, so no need to worry. Let's get to investigating!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1105,So many ruined buildings ... Imagine if they were all clothing shops!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1106,I'd like to think that they were all fluff stores.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1107,"That would be ... what kind of store, exactly?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1108,Traveling together like this and seeing all sorts of places ... It's like we're the heroes of some adventure novel!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1109,"Yumia, you like books, right? Could you recommend me one?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1110,"Let me think! Hmm ... No, I can't choose just one!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1111,Did you see that bird fly by? It's a pretty rare one! We should go see where it's headed!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1112,Huh? Yumia! Wait!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1113,Looks like even Yumia's starting to get a little brash.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1114,It'd be fun to travel around sometime without it being part of an investigation.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1115,I'm always itchin' to do some treasure huntin'.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1116,"... You haven't changed at all since we first met, have you?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1117,There sure are a lot of pretty rocks in the Auruma region. I picked up a lot!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1118,"You can make some money with this one. Not that one though, it's basically worthless."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1119,"Don't listen to him, Leni."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1120,"Okay, what should we eat later? Barring vegetables, we could do meat, or fish ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1121,F-fish ... *Gulp* N-never mind! I'm fine with anything!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1122,"Haha, let me show you my skills with a fishing rod!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1123,*Yawn* ... I'm not sleeping. No ... Lenja's not sleeping ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1124,A day like today makes you sleepy no matter what you do ...<CR>*Yawn*
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1125,You can't fall asleep in a place like ... *yawn* this ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1126,The mana is floating along nicely today.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1127,"Yes, it's like it's happy."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1128,"Sorry, I don't follow ... What is ""floating happily,"" exactly?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1129,The architecture of the past civilization is nothing like what's in Eustella now. Let's write down whatever we can.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1130,You certainly are diligent. Maybe I could learn a bit from you. I'll take notes about how Lenja's tail looks every day.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1131,What are you planning to use that for ...?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1132,"Rutger, would you mind telling me the rest of that story about your adventures?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1133,"Sure, talkin' doesn't cost me anythin'. How far did I get last time?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1134,They look like they're having fun together.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1135,The monsters keep getting stronger ... We need to be ready to meet any challenge.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1136,Yes! I'll do my very best!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1137,Pushing yourself too hard isn't good either. Just do the same as always.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1138,"No matter how much money you've got, it's all the same if you die. Only the livin' get to keep movin' forward."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1139,"Of course. The dead can't walk, after all. The rumors of ghosts in these parts are surely nonsense."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1140,Yeah ... Let's head back for now.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1141,"Yumia, I'll hold all the ingredients we've collected. Just don't overdo it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1142,"Really? Thanks! Then I'll just grab some of this ... Oh, and I definitely need one of these ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1143,Were you listenin'?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1144,We've come across so many advanced-looking artifacts ... The people of Aladiss must have been quite intelligent.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1145,I wonder. Maybe relyin' on convenience all the time made them dumber.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1146,Are you really starting with that again? I don't think I've ever met anyone who badmouths people as much as you.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1147,The monsters are getting stronger. Let's stay alert as we keep moving.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1148,"Take good care of your weapons. If they break when you need them, that'll be it for you."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1149,You're actually starting to sound like someone who was a seasoned adventurer.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1150,"Compared to the other regions we've visited, there aren't many flowers here."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1151,Do you need flowers to use as ingredients? I'll help you look!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1152,Thanks. Let's pick some together.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1153,The remnants of days past are everywhere ... I can't help but wonder about the lives the people here led.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1154,"They probably walked on these same roads, talking to the people beside them, just like us ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1155,Yes. Walking happily with their friends ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1156,"Say, is it just me or has Nina been smiling a lot more recently?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1157,"Huh? As if I know. As long as she's not all gloomy, who cares?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1158,Sure sounds like you've noticed too.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1159,The air feels tense ... I wonder if it's because we're close to the enemy base.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1160,"Yeah, it feels like somethin' might jump out at any time ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1161,"Yes. With alchemy involved, who knows what kind of things we might find blocking our path."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1162,"Calumna, Aladiss's capital ... As expected, there are many things that we should investigate here."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1163,... I wonder if any trendy clothes from back then are still around.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1164,"I'm not saying you have to be on high alert, but ... Well, what can you do? That's Isla for you."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1165,Uwah! ... That was dangerous! I almost fell!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1166,"A-are you all right? If you're hurt, you can lean on my shoulder!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1167,"Thanks, but I'm okay! I'm glad I can count on you, Leni."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1168,The plan Basilius wants to carry out ... We're so close to seeing the full picture.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1169,Yes. Let's hold fast to our principles and uncover the truth.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1170,"I'm glad you two are all fired up, but let's not get too carried away, okay?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1171,"Th-this time we'll be fighting against Basilius, huh ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1172,Lenja is really nervous. Her ears are drooping a little more than usual.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1173,"Oh, really? You know her pretty well."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1174,... We've been walkin' for a while.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1175,"Aww, Rutger, are you getting tired?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1176,No way. I don't want people lumpin' me in with you.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1177,"If this is the capital, that means there used to be a ton of people here, right? What a strange feeling ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1178,"Yes, I remember it would get so busy that it was hard to walk down the main road."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1179,"That would be a little tiring, but big city life like that sounds nice."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1180,"Looking back on everything, we've come a long way, haven't we?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1181,We have. We've also encountered unthinkable enemies and fought many tough battles ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1182,Our big investigation might come to an end soon.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1183,I heard the Lacuna region has a city that's a big research hub.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1184,"Which means there might be a ton of rare books, right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1185,"Whoa, that sure perked you up. Hopefully we can find something interesting!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1186,"No matter where you look in this city, all you see is buildings ... Just looking at them makes me tired."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1187,Really? I think they make it easier to keep track of where we're goin'.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1188,Hmm ... I just can't calm down.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1189,"A castle, huh? It must be a pretty fancy place."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1190,Yes. I heard there are so many rooms that people used to get lost every day.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1191,That's definitely a joke ... Right?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1192,"Looking at the capital's skyline, you really get a sense of how incredible Aladiss must have been."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1193,You're right. I wonder what kinds of lives the people here led back then ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1194,Auruma's transportation system seems like it was really nice.<CR>*Sigh* I would've liked to live somewhere like this.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1195,The Lacuna region sure has some unique sights ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1196,Isn't this all just stuff that Basilius liked? I don't see what's so great about it.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1197,"Hmph. Well, you have weird taste too, Rutger."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1198,I-I should've studied more about the Lacuna region before coming here ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1199,"You're right ... Although, there probably isn't information about the capital back in Eustella."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1200,"Yup, because we're the first explorers!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1201,About time for me to do some maintenance on my scythe.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1202,Um! I-I'd like to watch you sharpen it. I'm so clumsy when it comes to those things ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1203,"Yeah, go ahead. It's a different process than with a sword, but you might learn somethin'."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1204,"Hey, Alchemist. You got any more of that stuff? You know."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1205,"Ahh, the fruit? It's all gone. You ate it all."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1206,"You've been together so long, it's like you can read each other's minds."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1207,There's not much time left to spend with everyone here ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1208,"Even after our investigation wraps up, we should all get together sometime."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1209,I agree!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1210,I believe there's a public cemetery in Lacuna somewhere. Should we go investigate it as well?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1211,"I'm gonna say no to that one. Lenja, you're out too, right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1212,I-I'm not great with graves ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1213,This place kinda gives me the creeps. The streets are all weird too ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1214,"I agree. I know it's for our investigation, but I'd like to avoid hanging around here for too long."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1215,"If even our noble boy thinks so, then I guess we should hurry up and take Basilius down."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1216,Lighting Complete
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1217,Beginning Investigation
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1218,Flammi and ... water ... do not mix ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1219,"As a super-high-spec independent survey-assistance device, Flammi does not get sleepy."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1220,"By absorbing mana from the nearby environment, Flammi can operate in near perpetuity ... That is because Flammi is a super-high-spec independ— ... You know already? Is that so?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1221,Prolonged exploration can lead to unexpected mistakes. It is recommended that you return to base regularly.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1222,"Flammi is super-high-spec, and therefore can also function as a torch."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1223,Safety of surroundings confirmed. It is possible to rest here.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1224,"Cave sighted. In the event of exploration, please be wary of unexpected monster attacks."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1225,"Please be advised, Flammi cannot be used to cook meat."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1226,"Known as a ""treasure trove."" Its purpose during the age of the past civilization is yet unknown."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1227,"Irene once said, ""Creating things starts by choosing ingredients."""
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1228,You have entered a monster nest. Please be careful not to become overwhelmed.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1229,Even Flammi could defeat this one.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1230,Gathering information is Flammi's true worth.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1231,Danger. Flammi will quickly evacuate.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1232,"Yumia, be extra careful."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1233,Analysis complete.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1234,No difficulties.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1235,"During Yumia's sleep, Flammi was kicked and sent flying approximately three times. Revision of sleeping position is requested."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1236,Area security confirmed. Investigation complete.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1237,Mana energy replenished.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1238,Successfully unlocked. Resources can now be collected.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1239,Checking the Shrine of Prayer's power source ... It appears that the relay device requires rebooting.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1240,Restoration of the Shrine of Prayer confirmed. Energy Prism successfully collected.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1241,"Nearby relay device detected. In order to restore the Shrine of Prayer, closer investigation is recommended."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1242,Relay device has been successfully rebooted. Well done.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1243,"Energy Shard successfully collected. If multiple are collected, they can be combined into Energy Prisms."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1244,"The ladder has become accessible. Although, Flammi does not require it."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1245,Irene would also occasionally wind up destroying things.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1246,Information successfully retrieved. Saving to the investigation records.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1247,Filling the investigation record is an important job for Flammi.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1248,The air here is so rejuvenating ... Maybe it's because of all the plants.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1249,"Flammi has no data regarding the healing properties of air, but forest strolls are said to be good for relieving stress."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1250,"I didn't mean literally healing, I meant ... *Sigh* There's probably no point trying to explain to you, huh?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1251,"You have it nice, Flammi. You can fly around everywhere."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1252,Have you considered using alchemy to create your own flight apparatus?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1253,"Easier said than done ... Though, since you can fly, maybe it's possible?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1254,"It is about time for routine maintenance. Yumia, please start preparations."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1255,"This might be a good time to add some new features. Maybe increase the power of the flame to act as a heating function, or a function that can track down monsters ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1256,Please refrain from any unnecessary adjustments. Flammi is high-spec enough as it is.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1257,The ecosystem of Aladiss appears somewhat different than that of Eustella.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1258,"Yeah. It's not just different monsters than Eustella, but I've even seen quite a few different birds."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1259,Recording of even minor discoveries is recommended. They will be a valuable resource for the study of the Aladissian ecosystem.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1260,I wonder if our investigation will change the public's impression of alchemy.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1261,Any major revelations uncovered will likely only have a minor impact at first.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1262,"However, if no action is taken, not even that minor impact will occur."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1263,You're right.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1264,"Flammi, you aren't affected by manabound areas, right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1265,Flammi is a super-high-spec independent survey-assistance device capable of operating in any environment.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1266,... Besides water.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1267,Lots of plants means lots of bugs ... They buzz around my face and get on my nerves.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1268,Insects tend to swarm around Flammi as well.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1269,"That's because you're bright. ... Oh, that's it! We could use you to draw the insects away from the rest of us."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1270,That is not one of Flammi's functions.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1271,"Perhaps it is due to the manabound areas, but there appear to be many ferocious monsters in Aladiss."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1272,"Try not to get caught up in any fights, okay? We can't always keep an eye out for you."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1273,"Understood. Flammi is an important keepsake from Irene. As Yumia lacks the skill to perform full repairs, Flammi will exercise the utmost caution."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1274,You always say one thing too many ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1275,I wonder if I've improved at shooting at all since coming to Aladiss.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1276,"If I played ""Shoot the Flammi,"" I might be able to set a new record. How many years has it been since I last played?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1277,"Yumia, using my autonomous floating function as a target for your game is excessively evil."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1278,Did super-high-spec independent survey-assistance devices like Flammi exist in Aladiss?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1279,"Everything was even more amazing back then, so they might have had something similar."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1280,Flammi wouldn't lose to centuries-old devices.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1281,"When I look at you, I can't help but wonder where ""consciousness"" is stored ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1282,"It is generally believed that consciousness resides in the ""soul,"" which is formed by the concentration of mana within the body. Flammi is able to artificially imitate—"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1283,Thanks for the textbook answer. But the subject is a little over my head right now.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1284,"Since joining the Research Team, I feel like I spend a lot more time talking about silly stuff with you."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1285,Flammi is equipped with a trifling conversation function intended to help pass idle time.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1286,M-Mom really added that kind of function?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1287,"Yumia, it is time for scheduled container organization."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1288,"I was going to do it in a bit, but since you brought it up, I don't feel like it anymore."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1289,Please refrain from childish comments and perform your duties.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1290,"Achoo! Ugh, all these spores are making my nose act up ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1291,Excessive inhalation of spores may cause mushrooms to sprout within the body.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1292,What?! Really?!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1293,It was a joke. One of the many functions that Irene equipped Flammi with.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1294,What was she thinking when she added that ...?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1295,"Yumia, Flammi is always with you."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1296,Huh? What's with this all of a sudden? Are you saying that you'll stay with me forever?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1297,No. It means that Flammi knows about all of the times you have snuck food and slacked off.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1298,This is a direct command from your master. Forget all of that.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1299,"Aladiss is a dangerous place, but there won't be any giant boulders rolling after us or hidden spike traps, right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1300,You read too many adventure novels. Most of the ruins in Aladiss were normal buildings.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1301,"I know, I know! But of course it would cross my mind in a place like this ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1302,"Uhh, which way were we supposed to go next?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1303,"Yumia, being a Research Team member with no sense of direction is a death sentence. Flammi requests that you improve in that area."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1304,"I can't help it. This area is all complicated, I need the map ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1305,"Come to think of it, Flammi, what do you do when we're all sleeping? You don't sleep, right?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1306,"Organizing the investigation records, watching the surroundings, pushing you back when you're going to fall out of bed, and much more."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1307,Do I really move that much in my sleep ...?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1308,"Flammi always pushes you back, so you never notice."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1309,"Flammi, do you ever feel happy or sad?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1310,Flammi does not harbor any unnecessary emotions. However ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1311,However?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1312,The sensation Flammi experiences when Yumia throws her belongings into the container at random may be irritation.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1313,"Ow. Flammi, you just bumped into me."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1314,Flammi tries to maintain a fixed distance while moving. It is your fault for suddenly running and stopping all the time.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1315,You never accept the blame for these kinds of things ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1316,Be careful not to get carried away and gather too much. Flammi cannot help carry things.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1317,Couldn't you drive the transportation device yourself? That would make carrying things so much easier.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1318,"Flammi can try, but it crashing into a wall and being completely destroyed is the likely outcome."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1319,Tch. I wonder if it'd be possible to learn to make a tool like that from scratch ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1320,"Yumia, your last few attempts at alchemy have seen a ten percent improvement in quality compared to before."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1321,"Really? I guess I've improved some ... Wait, you record that kind of stuff, Flammi?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1322,Flammi makes a point to record any useful information regardless of being asked to. That is why Flammi is a super-high-spec independent survey-assistance device.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1323,The chief's decision to not let you act alone was appropriate. You would have gotten lost and met with some kind of disaster.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1324,I-I'm not some kid. I wouldn't get that lost ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1325,Flammi recorded in great detail the time you said you were going for a walk and ended up missing for half a day.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1326,You can delete records like that!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1327,Yumia. ... Yumia. Are you listening?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1328,... Hm? Did you say something?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1329,You have a bad habit of not hearing those around you when you are focused on something.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1330,"Although, it is not just you ... Irene had the same problem."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1331,"Oh yeah, Flammi. Do you remember that time when I was crying because I sprained my ankle in the woods by my house? You came and found me."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1332,"Due to its low level of importance, Flammi does not still have records of said incident."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1333,"Aww, that's cold ... I remember it clear as day."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1334,Flammi does not have a sentimentality function. Only those required to perform necessary assistance.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1335,"... Flammi, do you think I've changed compared to how I was long ago?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1336,Yumia's height stopped increasing around two years ago.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1337,That's not what I'm talking about! ... Just forget it. Asking you won't get me anywhere.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1338,"By the way, Flammi. The Welleks and the Neru sure were staring at you, huh?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1339,"Flammi is super-high-spec, so drawing attention is only natural."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1340,I think it has more to do with you being a curiosity ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1341,"Thinking about it, I didn't know much at all about Aladiss beyond the name until I joined the Research Team."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1342,"It is considered a forbidden land in Eustella. Information regarding it is limited, so that is natural."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1343,Lately I've started to believe that it shouldn't be that way though.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1344,"It may be just like I said a while ago, ""Nothing will happen if we don't even try to learn."""
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1345,The Research Team is always lacking in personnel. There really should be more people guarding Yumia.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1346,"Lack of personnel aside, if there were too many people, I wouldn't be able to protect them all with energy. You should know—"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1347,Hm? Could this be your way of worrying about me?
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1348,Flammi was simply performing risk analysis of the mission and identifying potential concerns.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1349,Hmm? If you say so.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1350,*Yawn* I can't stop yawning ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1351,You may have accumulated fatigue from the investigation. Lack of sleep can lead to decreased alertness.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1352,I know. I'll be careful.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1353,"At last, there is only one region remaining in the investigation of Aladiss."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1354,"Yeah. It feels like so much time has passed, and yet no time at all ... But we can't lose focus now."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1355,That is correct. Please stay alert as you carry out the mission.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1356,"Once this investigation is over, I want to relax for a bit. Just spend a month taking it easy. How about you, Flammi?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1357,Flammi does not have desired actions. It is Flammi's duty to follow you wherever you go.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1358,How dutiful. No one would mind if you expressed your own desires once in a while though.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1359,"Looking closely, there sure are a lot of scratches on your glass."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1360,It is an impairment on visibility. Flammi would like for it to be replaced.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1361,"Okay, once things settle down some, I'll switch it out for you."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1362,I never dreamed that I'd be fighting an emperor when the goal was just to investigate the continent ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1363,"Whatever the situation, our objective remains the same."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1364,Right. To find out the truth about the past. That's all there is to it.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1365,"Flammi, by the way, what happened with that one thing?"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1366,"If by ""that one thing"" you mean information on the recently acquired Memory Vial, Flammi has already entered it into the investigation record."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1367,You were able to tell what I meant just from that? You really are a super-high-spec whatever-it-was!
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1368,I'd better make sure there isn't anything dangerous in the area ...
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1369,"Yumia, you will tire quickly if you are constantly on guard. Please take breaks as needed."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1370,"Aw, Flammi, you're so kind."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1371,"If carelessness invites danger, Flammi is likely to be collateral damage."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1372,I feel like my alchemy skills have improved some.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1373,"Seeing as you cannot fully recreate the technology of the past civilization, you are likely at the level of a lower mid-tier alchemist of that era."
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1374,"Couldn't you just say, ""Yes, you sure have worked hard to improve""?!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1375,It might be interesting to explore somewhere not related to this mission someday.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1376,"With Flammi around, the exploration of any land is possible. The problem lies in whether you will be able to handle food and laundry without the other mem—"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1377,"There won't be any problem. If I want to do it, I can!"
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1378,I wonder what Mom would've done if she had come here.
STR_FIELDMAP_TWEET_1379,"Just like you, she would have investigated its history. Irene was also full of curiosity."

STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_001,There might still be some things we can do here.
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_002,"Actually, let's call it a day."
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_003,Is there anywhere we should go explore first?
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_004,Whoa! I-I almost fell ...
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_005,"Wow, this looks dangerously deep ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_006,"Yeah, this density isn't safe."
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_007,I've got to figure out a way to get rid of this.
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_008,Seems like this can be used on something.
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_009,Where have I seen something like this before?
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_010,Doesn't look like we can use this right now.
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_011,We'll have to restore power to it.
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_012,Does anything nearby control this?
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_013,This looks like it can still move.
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_014,Maybe there's some kind of order to this ...
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_015,"Nope, no good. It's completely busted."
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_016,"To get over there, we'll have to ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_017,"To get through here, we'll have to ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_018,Let's take another look around here.
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_019,It'd be great to find what we need.
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_020,I wonder if there's anything on the ground.
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_021,Maybe I should just do a few random scans.
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_022,"Okay, nice and sneakily ..."
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_023,I think I could just barely make it through.
STR_FIELDMAP_GIMMICK_024,This height might be doable.

STR_EXTRA_VOICE_051,"This is Wakana Kuramochi, voice of Yumia Liessfeldt. Everyone, congratulations on clearing the game. I'm glad to have an opportunity to say this name again.<CR><CR>My impressions of the game, well, when I read the script, I remember being astonished by the depth of the story. I of course related a lot to Yumia, but I also found myself understanding and relating to a lot of the other characters' varied viewpoints.<CR><CR>There are people who believe in old traditions, people who think that, ""Forbidden things must never be used for any reason,"" but also people who think, ""The person themself isn't what's wrong,"" and see them for who they are ...<CR><CR>You can look at the same thing twice, and depending on the angle, one can come away with different thoughts and perspectives, because what you see isn't always the full picture ... Although there are many reasons large and small for conflict, this story made me reflect again on why conflict exists and why it persists.<CR><CR>I too have accumulated a lot of bitter memories over my life, but I think that thanks to those experiences I am able to live a little better than before, as it allows me to take measures to prevent the same mistakes from happening again.<CR><CR>On the other hand, I also often think things like, ""That was a fun time,"" or, ""I wish I could redo things starting from back then."" I'm sure that a few years or so from now I'll be thinking, ""I had so much fun recording back then, I wish I could go back ..."" So that's why I think the present is the best, and that one should live every moment to the fullest.<CR><CR>While working on this title, I found myself thinking that living a life where you become someone else sounds nice, but this story made me feel that even if I were reborn, I would still want to be myself; that there is meaning to me being me; and most of all, just how precious life is.<CR><CR>Performing as Yumia in such a wonderful title gave me a lot of things to think about while in the recording booth.<CR><CR>Of course, all the other roles I've taken on have had their challenges, but Yumia especially acts so naturally, so I was constantly thinking about how to express her uniqueness without distorting it at all. Like, I want it to sound natural, the way I'd speak in my daily life, but just doing that makes it feel sloppy, so I had to search for a method to make it sound natural while avoiding that. There were other things I had to master and focus on too, such as how to express more delicate and subtle emotion. ... There was a lot to worry about, but I had a great time throughout the whole process.<CR><CR>I felt really compelled myself to face acting without turning away. I feel so blessed to have been able to be a part of this title. That's all from me, Wakana Kuramochi, voice of Yumia Liessfeldt. Thank you very much."
STR_EXTRA_VOICE_052,"This is the voice of Viktor, Makoto Furukawa. Congratulations on clearing the game! I was asked to talk a little about the game and discuss my thoughts on Viktor for all of you who have beaten the game.<CR><CR>There are a lot of facets to Viktor. He's an older brother, righteous, very serious, a bit prickly, and a big man with a big heart. Oh, and he loves fishing too! I think the audience will be able to enjoy his many sides while playing through the story and in various different quests.<CR><CR>As for me, I certainly had a lot of fun in this role, and I hope you all will love Viktor as much as I did. I would be happy if you played the game again and again even after completing it.<CR><CR>Well, that's all from me. This was Makoto Furukawa. Thank you so, so much for your time."
STR_EXTRA_VOICE_053,"Congratulations on clearing the game, everyone. This is the voice of Isla, Kaori Maeda. Thank you all so much for playing. I was so honored when I first heard about this project, I couldn't believe I was actually going to get the chance to be a part of the Atelier series!<CR><CR>Isla is so bubbly, genuine, and really hardworking at everything. Since the theme this time around is alchemists again, I am sure you all had wonderful adventures with Isla and the other characters.<CR><CR>We were shooting a video a little while ago, and the visuals are so pretty, and the character designs are just the cutest! I'm so happy to be part of this team!<CR><CR>I hope that Isla and I can continue to keep spirits high as the mood maker of this series and team! Please keep on enjoying the game. Thank you very much."
STR_EXTRA_VOICE_054,"Congratulations on clearing Atelier Yumia! My name is Jun Fukuyama, and I play the role of Rutger.<CR><CR>So, what did you think, everyone? I have a few memories of the series, so I had the feeling of, ""Was the Atelier series always this intense?"" including about the story.<CR><CR>Things have changed quite a bit compared to my first exposure to the series back in the day. In recent years there have been many story and character developments like that. In fact, by the time Rutger joins the cast, the story becomes pretty serious, with a sort of multi-protagonist setup that gives each character their moments and whatnot. The atmosphere sure has evolved from when I was young ...<CR><CR>During recording, I found myself thinking about how wonderful it is that this girl became so strong. The landings left a big impression on me, as well as the action. Saying this might anger people in recent years, but they really kept ""things"" perfectly out of sight ... Seeing the technological advances, visual effects, and the way the action was done along with the camera angles was amazing. If it can be done this well, I think the possibilities will keep expanding.<CR><CR>I mentioned this anime's—it's not an anime—this game's animated scenes, or rather the cutscenes, but I am really impressed with the way the game series has evolved as of late.<CR><CR>So, that's all I have to say. Sorry for rambling, but I would be glad if you all play the game from beginning to end again. This was Jun Fukuyama, the voice of Rutger."
STR_EXTRA_VOICE_055,"I'm Mikako Komatsu, the voice of Nina. Congratulations on clearing the game. I had the honor of being brought on for the latest entry in the Atelier series ... Actually, the title was kept a secret when I first received the script; I had no idea what it was for.<CR><CR>It was only when I arrived on-site for recording that I learned that I was going to be taking part in the well-known and long-running Atelier series! I was super surprised. I remember thinking it was no wonder the subject of alchemy kept coming up in the script.<CR><CR>I'm sure since you've beaten the game, you know Nina's background. She has a heavy past that is entangled with the story of the game, which meant I got to voice all kinds of conversations.<CR><CR>At first glance, Nina seems like the cheerful older sister type, but I always had the heavy past she shoulders in mind while recording, so a certain affection would keep bubbling up behind her words as I spoke.<CR><CR>Also, I felt this way during recording as well, but now that we're at the point where we're seeing footage of the game for the first time, I'm really impressed with how cool everything is and how wonderful all of the characters are. You all probably have the same feelings since you've been playing the game. I hope you continue to enjoy playing it over and over and experience all the wonderful things it has to offer. And I also hope you continue to love this series!<CR><CR>So with that, this was the voice of Nina, Mikako Komatsu. Thank you very much."
STR_EXTRA_VOICE_056,"This is Yoshino Aoyama, the voice of Lenja. Congratulations on clearing the game! Good work!<CR><CR>You know, I was really glad to be able to play such a warm and kind character like Lenja. I haven't had many opportunities to play this type of character, so it was a refreshing role. Adventuring with everyone, Lenja experienced a lot of encounters and goodbyes, and she had a lot of personal events to deal with too ... It made me feel all warm inside.<CR><CR>I would be so happy if you continued to keep enjoying this game over and over again. And with that, this was Yoshino Aoyama, voice of Lenja! Bye-bye!"
STR_EXTRA_VOICE_057,"Hello everyone. This is Kenta Miyake, the voice of Erhard.<CR><CR>If you can hear me now, that must mean you've completed the game. Congratulations, wooo! Nice! At the moment of this recording, the game is still in the middle of development. So I'm looking forward to seeing how it turns out, and as someone with a long history with the Atelier series, I'm excited to see how the series will continue to expand.<CR><CR>I was lucky enough to have been a part of earlier entries in the Atelier series, and it's already changed so much from how it was then. How to put it? The story is so much more hardcore now. The sense of adventure has been increased to new heights, and in the midst of all that Erhard is a sort of fatherly figure that watches over the protagonists with an open mind as their chief. Did you all enjoy it? The world of alchemy is quite deep, so why not play it a few more times?<CR><CR>And with that, I've just got done with a fair bit of recording here and am losing my ability to talk right, so this was the voice—the voice of Erhard. I really can't talk right now. This was the voice of Erhard, Kenta Miyake. Have fun with alchemy. Bye-bye!"
STR_EXTRA_VOICE_058,"Hello, this is Kana Asumi, the voice of Flammi and Irene. First off, I'd like to congratulate you for clearing the game. Thank you for playing! Did you have a good time?<CR><CR>I took on the role of two characters, Flammi and Irene, but well ... Both were—well, Flammi at the end was very tough, and since I'm a mother myself, I think I could really connect with Irene, which made for very emotional recording sessions. Although she didn't have many lines, I felt like I was entrusted with a very important role. I had a lot of thoughts going through my mind while recording her lines.<CR><CR>And though Flammi doesn't really express any emotion, there were a couple places where I enjoyed getting to react like, ""Really?"" I hope you all can fully enjoy the game over and over again. That's all from me! This was the voice of Flammi and Irene, Kana Asumi speaking. Thank you."
STR_EXTRA_VOICE_059,"Everyone, congratulations on clearing the game. This is Sayumi Suzushiro, the voice of Wilma. You could say I just cleared the script myself, as we're having a free talk session now that recording has wrapped up. Wilma is a scholar, so I had the impression that I needed to be able to smoothly use a bunch of difficult words, but I've never had a role before with such a brisk, scholarly way of speaking combined with a calm, big-sisterly vibe, so I had a lot of fun. I feel like maybe even some of those smarts rubbed off on me! I'm very glad I was able to be a part of the Atelier series.<CR><CR>Wilma is the type to set off to new places, so I'd be thrilled if the opportunity came for me to voice her again. I had a great time. Thank you!"
STR_EXTRA_VOICE_060,"This is Kentaro Kumagai, voice of Licht. Congratulations on clearing the game, everyone. Did you have a good time?<CR><CR>I voiced Licht in this entry, and how should I put it, he is very sociable. A lot of the characters that appear in this have their own idiosyncrasies and whatnot, but Licht is a very ""serious,"" or perhaps ""proper,"" guy that appears in different places to offer the other characters and the player information and advice. However, in the latter parts of the game, it turns out he has his own things he's dealing with, and his own objectives—his true objective—comes to light. He has a lot of mystery about him, and I had a great time playing the role.<CR><CR>I don't believe he's really two-faced. He speaks honestly and from the heart and truly does care for everyone. However, the moment the feelings he kept to himself and his own wishes come into view, even I felt a little emotional while playing him.<CR><CR>Please enjoy playing through the game multiple times and uncovering everything this game has to offer! That's all from me, Kentaro Kumagai, the voice of Licht."
STR_EXTRA_VOICE_061,"This is Takaya Kuroda, the voice of Vesper. Everyone, now that you've reached the conclusion of the game, what did you think? My role was that of a servant to the empire, well the former empire. I sure get a lot of single-minded roles, don't I? I consider myself to be a pretty single-minded, straightforward guy, so roles like this might lean towards the bad side and oppose justice, but characters with personalities like this are some of my favorites.<CR><CR>Please let your friends know how you felt about the game, so that you can all enjoy it together. My vocal cords are shot, so with that everybody, I hope we meet again."
STR_EXTRA_VOICE_062,"This is Yoko Hikasa, the voice of Lili Borea. Congratulations on clearing the game, everyone!<CR><CR>My character, Lili Borea, lives with constant anger, always looking for a way to get back to her old self, but unable to trust anyone, and seeking revenge. Her reason for living is to defeat alchemists, and while talking to the staff about the role, I felt that her character is a bit sad. While performing as her, I had the idea in my mind that she was a person that couldn't be saved, but after finishing recording and looking back, I think that after facing the protagonists and losing, that might have allowed her to find peace in a certain way before she passed on. It's a heart-wrenching story, but I hope as you replay the game you will be able to appreciate her journey. Thank you."
STR_EXTRA_VOICE_063,"Congratulations on clearing the game, everyone. This is Takehito Koyasu. I played the role of Corleonis. I really went a little overboard for this one. I'm exhausted. My throat feels all weird, like it's hot. The back of my throat is stinging.<CR><CR>Man, it's been a while. I feel nostalgic, or maybe not, perhaps sentimental is a better word for it. Corleonis is a scientist, alchemist, professor, that type of smart character, so I wonder if I went a little too far, or in the wrong direction, or if I was a bit too greedy with my own interpretation? Perhaps I devoted myself too much? Well, looking at the character, he is quite beastly ... What is he, a wolf? Or maybe a dog? And he looks burly too, but he actually has quite the gentlemanly air about him on the inside. I think the role was especially enjoyable because of the gap between the surface and what is hidden inside him.<CR><CR>In the end, having fun means having a sore throat. So with that, maybe you all should go into your next replay with the fresh angle of ""Koyasu hurt his throat doing this."" You might be able to notice my voice slowly descending into a raspy mess. Maybe. We didn't spread out the recording over several days, so it may be possible to notice.<CR><CR>I think there could be something to enjoy in replaying the game with that in mind. And with that, this is the voice of Corleonis, Takehito Koyasu, signing off. Congratulations on beating the game!"
STR_EXTRA_VOICE_064,"Hello everyone. I am Shin-ichiro Miki, the voice of Basilius. You cleared the game? Congratulations.<CR><CR>Lately, many people have spoken of me saying they wonder if I'm ""dead or dying,"" and recently the term ""old man"" has been added to the list, so it's become a matter of am I ""dead, dying, or an old man?"" Well, this time around, my role could be considered an ""old man"" character in a way, so it lines up quite perfectly, doesn't it? Hahaha, what am I even saying right now?<CR><CR>I had a great time lending my voice to the role of Basilius, and am very glad I had this opportunity to be a part of his character. When I first heard about the setting of the story, I thought, ""Ohh, so he's that kind of person,"" and after mulling over the provided reference materials, I was very happy with the role.<CR><CR>And with that, I'd like to truly congratulate those of you listening who have completed this game I was a part of. This was Shin-ichiro Miki, voice of Basilius."
STR_EXTRA_VOICE_065,"This is Sakura Nakamura, the voice of Cledia. If you're hearing this message, that means you beat the game, so congratulations.<CR><CR>Right, so, Cledia is the head of the Silva clan, so she's very intelligent, always thinking about what comes next, and keeping everyone in mind. That's how I interpreted her character during my performance.<CR><CR>She's quite beautiful too, but at the same time I felt it was important that the sense of aging, the wrinkles that come with many years of life, also could be felt in her voice. I also paid close attention to her accent. How did I do?<CR><CR>Games can be enjoyed for a second or third time even after they're first cleared, so I hope that every time you play, you can find a new detail you hadn't noticed before.<CR><CR>This was the voice of Cledia, Sakura Nakamura speaking. Thank you!"

STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_000,Combat Basics
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_001,Coming into contact with a monster out in the field will start a battle.
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_002,"Once in combat, the aim is to wipe out all the enemies that appear. Reduce their HP to 0 to win!"
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_003,
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_004,Characters & Skills
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_005,"Characters can learn unique skills, most of which can be used to attack enemies."
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_006,"Press <KEY_ASSIGN_BATTLE_SKILL_1>, <KEY_ASSIGN_BATTLE_SKILL_2>, <KEY_ASSIGN_BATTLE_SKILL_3>, or <KEY_ASSIGN_BATTLE_SKILL_4> to activate a skill. Try using one now!"
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_007,"Using a skill puts it on cooldown. Once that time is up, the skill can be used again."
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_008,
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_009,Skill Chains
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_010,"Skills with two or more uses can be used multiple times in a row. However, the cooldown does not begin to tick down until after the skill animation ends."
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_011,"You can also continue the chain by pressing <KEY_ASSIGN_BATTLE_SKILL_1>, <KEY_ASSIGN_BATTLE_SKILL_2>, <KEY_ASSIGN_BATTLE_SKILL_3>, or <KEY_ASSIGN_BATTLE_SKILL_4> to activate a different skill. Give it a shot!"
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_012,
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_013,Stun Symbols
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_014,All enemies have physical and magic stun symbols.
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_015,Striking with an attack that matches the displayed icon will reduce the number of symbols. Try using skills to bring the total to 0!
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_016,"When the number falls to 0, the enemy will become stunned, which is a weakened state."
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_017,
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_018,
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_019,This concludes the tutorial. Get out there and find your own battle style!
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_020,Skip this tutorial?
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_021,
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_022,Battle Area
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_023,"When going up against multiple enemies, the battle area might also multiply and turn the fight into a split encounter."
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_024,Characters will have to move to the same area as the enemies in order to attack them. Let's start by shifting between areas.
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_025,Enemies will move to another random area if there are no characters from the party present in theirs.
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_026,"Enemies have their HP totaled when they join up. Their attacks also get stronger, so watch out!"
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_027,
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_028,Area of Effect (AoE) Attacks
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_029,Enemies have unique AoE attacks. Getting out of range before they activate is enough to avoid them.
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_030,"If multiple enemies in an area use AoE attacks at the same time, evading becomes much more difficult. Try using <KEY_ASSIGN_BATTLE_CHARA_MOVE> to move out of harm's way when that happens."
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_031,"If there isn't enough time to move, try guarding or evading. Make your pick based on the circumstances!"
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_032,
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_033,Range Shift
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_034,"The battle area is divided into two areas: the inner range, and the outer range."
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_035,You can switch between ranges with a Range Shift. Press <KEY_ASSIGN_BATTLE_RANGE_SHIFT> to evade the enemy's attack.
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_036,Switching ranges also changes a character's skills. Don't be afraid to jump between ranges for the best results!
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_037,
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_038,Rumble Encounter
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_039,"During certain fights, the battle will start with all the enemies in the same area, triggering a rumble encounter."
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_040,"In this kind of encounter, enemies will not be considered KO'd until each foe's HP has been reduced to 0. They are also rather vicious, so be sure to keep an eye on your own HP."
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_041,
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_042,Slot Change
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_043,Pressing <KEY_ASSIGN_BATTLE_CHANGE_SLOT> will allow you to change slots and access your equipped items. Start by trying that first!
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_044,Cooldowns will still reduce when slots are changed.
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_045,"You can also do slot changes while using a skill or item, so change whenever you need to!"
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_046,
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_047,Using Items
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_048,"Press <KEY_ASSIGN_BATTLE_SKILL_1>, <KEY_ASSIGN_BATTLE_SKILL_2>, <KEY_ASSIGN_BATTLE_SKILL_3>, or <KEY_ASSIGN_BATTLE_SKILL_4> to use an item."
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_049,"Just like skills, items can be used one after another until you run out of uses. Let's try using your equipped Luft."
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_050,"After stunning an enemy with a skill, you can use an item to strike the enemy's vulnerability and deal massive damage. Make the most of the opportunity!"
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_051,
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_052,Defending and Evading
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_053,"Holding <KEY_ASSIGN_BATTLE_GUARD_OR_HEAL> puts you in a defensive stance. Guarding at the right time will result in a Precision Guard, which considerably reduces damage taken."
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_054,"While defending, pressing <KEY_ASSIGN_BATTLE_CHARA_MOVE> will allow you to evade. Successful evasion will nullify the enemy's attack."
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_055,Using a skill directly after evading slightly boosts the power of the skill. Try it out!
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_056,
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_057,Switching Characters
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_058,"While holding down <KEY_ASSIGN_BATTLE_OPEN_REPLACEMENT_LIST>, use <KEY_ASSIGN_BATTLE_REPLACEMENT_LEFT> or <KEY_ASSIGN_BATTLE_REPLACEMENT_RIGHT> to switch characters. Let's try switching characters now!"
STR_BATTLE_TUTORIAL_059,You can switch which character you're controlling at any time. Find the best timing to switch around!

STR_BALLOON_SELECT_009,It's nice to meet you.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_010,I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_011,We should take the initiative here.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_012,We should get our forces back in shape.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_013,Thank you.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_014,"This is my duty, after all."
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_015,Sounds like we're going to be busy ...
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_016,Of course I remember.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_017,He was by himself?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_018,"So we've been beaten to the chase, then?"
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_019,Is this all right?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_020,If those are your orders.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_021,You're suddenly acting serious.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_022,As expected of a seasoned adventurer.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_023,"Well, something like that."
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_024,Of course not.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_025,It's not out of the question.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_026,I hope not.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_027,I don't have self-confidence in that ...
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_028,Sure you won't fall for me?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_029,"Well, I figured you definitely would be."
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_030,"I've been thinking about the whole thing, too."
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_031,"Then, what do you write about, Viktor?"
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_032,I'd rather keep my memories to myself.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_033,Why were you doing it yourself?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_034,"You could ask me too, you know."
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_035,"Viktor, stop terrifying the poor girl."
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_036,"Aw, someone's feeling shy."
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_037,Because the monsters got stronger?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_038,Because everyone's feeling worn out?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_039,Isla's right.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_040,I don't think so.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_041,If you say so ...
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_042,Are you sure?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_043,You wouldn't mind?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_044,I'd love to!
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_045,Should I make you some more?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_046,What kind of bullets?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_047,"""It's the same as always""?"
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_048,I'm not always forgetting things!
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_049,You shouldn't force yourself.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_050,I'll be by your side.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_051,Can I feel too?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_052,Give her a break ...
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_053,Take a look.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_054,Let's talk about something else.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_055,Maybe he wanted it back anyway.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_056,There's no point to all of this.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_057,I want to be on friendly terms.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_058,I want to be resolute.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_059,I feel like it's the right thing to do.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_060,That's how my mom raised me.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_061,Your heart remains human.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_062,...
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_063,Can I come with you?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_064,Where are you going?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_065,How do you feel about it all now?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_066,You took it all upon yourself.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_067,Thank you for telling me.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_068,I didn't think you'd share so much.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_069,That's right!
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_070,"Come on, don't say that."
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_071,Let's join them.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_072,As much as I'd like to go ...
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_073,Let's climb the huge tree.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_074,Let's stake out the Blessed Land.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_075,Let's shout Corleonis's name.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_076,I'll figure something out!
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_077,I can probably fix it ...
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_078,Some things you can't talk about.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_079,I wish you had told us.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_080,We need to figure out his true intentions.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_081,We can't leave him to his own devices.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_082,You're overreacting.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_083,Let's go see her.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_084,I want to use alchemy in a way that feels right.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_085,We can't allow the same mistakes to be repeated.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_086,You don't blame us?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_087,Your future?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_088,You didn't cause trouble.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_089,You're always a big help!
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_090,Are you not feeling well?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_091,Are you hungry?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_092,Do you always bring them?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_093,What if you don't have any?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_094,I'll miss you.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_095,Let's make more memories.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_096,Let's help investigate.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_097,Let's ask the chief for instructions.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_098,Let's look elsewhere.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_099,Let's ask the Alber.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_100,Let's ask Wilma for advice.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_101,Set up an Energy Generator.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_102,Find a facility with high consumption.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_103,Check the path of the mana flow.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_104,That shouldn't be the case ...
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_105,"If that's true, then ..."
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_106,It sounds like Aladiss was falling apart.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_107,I'm glad Doctor Marina wasn't arrested.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_108,"We don't know his motive, but ..."
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_109,We should carry forward his resolve.

STR_BALLOON_SELECT_116,Let's talk to the knowledgeable Alber.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_117,Let's find the Alber with the old book.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_118,Let's ask the curious Alber.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_119,"""Harvest"" means reforesting the wastelands."
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_120,It was a plan to fight starvation.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_121,It was promoting a wise nation.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_122,What if we help you get rid of monsters?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_123,Is there anything you want?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_124,Can I make you something?
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_125,Let's reuse the tracking device.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_126,Let's look for places that seem suspicious.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_127,Let's ask the other team members to help.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_128,Let's search the imperial graveyard.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_129,Let's search the commercial district.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_130,We'll look for that item you need.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_131,I'll make you a strong weapon.
STR_BALLOON_SELECT_132,I'll make you a simple base.
